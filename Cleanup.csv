comment_text: After discussion with @lizkrznarich, these use a valid escape syntax and so should not be deleted. We should update the search API to accommodate.

I wrote a script to pull the ~400 records with this issue. The most common error is trailing whitespace, followed by semicolons and commas.

3. Confirm (country) matches Geonames country
4. Investigate usecases for having more than one record

comment_text: Inconsistent country naming is a result of shifting values on the Geonames side and us incrementally updating addresses on the basis of update requests. We will likely do a complete address refresh when we do a new schema version or some other kind of mass update.
