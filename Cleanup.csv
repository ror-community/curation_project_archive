I wrote a script to pull the ~400 records with this issue. The most common error is trailing whitespace, followed by semicolons and commas.

We should clean these records up as follows:

1. Find all records with (country) in name [attached spreadsheet]
2. Identify which of above have no duplicates, and remove (country) from name
3. Confirm (country) matches Geonames country
4. Investigate usecases for having more than one record
5. Investigate search handling to optimize retrieval of duplicates with same name in different countries
6. Review duplicates and identify which ones can/should be merged
7. For duplicates that remain, remove (country) from name
