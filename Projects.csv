Adding the ""... of the CAS"" suffixes would help, otherwise the names are sometimes rather generic.

comment_text: I'm also not sure but I think the point is there are lots of hospitals in the Netherlands that don't have ROR id's yet? But I don't think we want to create ID's for every hospital - we certainly haven't done that for every hospital in the US or other countries!

The Wikidata query at least as transcribed here is a bit garbled; I edited and trimmed it down to the following:
https://w.wiki/4Kyd
which lists the hospital networks in the Netherlands, how many individual hospital (buildings?) they have, and the ROR id if they have one. It's 69 hospital groups, of which 16 (mostly the larger ones) currently have ROR id's. I don't think it's justified to add ROR id's for the remaining 53; we could look through them one by one to see if they are used as affiliations or otherwise  appear in research publications, but that seems a bit too much for our resources right now. Also the request was nominally to ""split an existing ROR record"" but I don't see that in this query or request at all, so  I have to say I'm a little confused as to what is actually being asked for.

comment_text: Ah, but it turns out a lot of the individual hospitals have ROR id's themselves (at least as recorded in  WIkidata):
https://w.wiki/4Kyg
-- that is, of the 69 hospital groups, 47 have at least one hospital with a ROR id. That includes 5 groups that have their own ROR id's. It seems a bit of a mess, I'll see if I can make better sense of it all and try to propose a way forward here.

comment_text: I created a google doc with the full list from Wikidata  here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GPjrMuojAUwzKKh4-03MHWFYXdjGDLXbHbUcogo9Hbs/edit?usp=sharing

The following hospital group/networks don't have any ROR id's themselves, nor any subsidiary hospitals with ROR's (at least as counted here):
* Ommelander Ziekenhuis Groningen (Q1943201)
* Pantein (Q1978017)
* ZorgSaam Ziekenhuis (Q3034260)
* St Jansdal Ziekenhuis (Q59384173)
* Saxenburgh Groep (Q97380654)
* Antonius Zorggroep (Q97382945)
* Rivas Zorggroep (Q97383459)
* BovenIJ Ziekenhuis (Q97456244)
* St. Jans Gasthuis (Q97482069)
* Spijkenisse Medisch Centrum (Q97500811)
* Wilhelmina Ziekenhuis Assen (Q97537594)

I would suggest these do not need ROR id's at this time, though we could run them through our usual check for use as affiliations if we thought it justified?

The  following hospital groups have no ROR id, but do have either multiple subsidiaries with a ROR id, or one with a ROR id and a considerably different name, so I think we should create a new ROR id for these ""top-level"" research-involved hospital organizations: 
* OLVG (Q21152541)
* Dijklander Ziekenhuis (Q62022997)
* Zorgpartners Friesland (Q97377399)
* Stichting Reinier Haga Groep (Q97383180)
* Santiz (Q97387477)
* Erasmus Medisch Centrum (Q97482050)
* Leids Universitair Medisch Centrum (Q97485881)
* Universitair Medisch Centrum Groningen (Q97534083)
* Universitair Medisch Centrum St. Radboud (Q97534111)
* Universitair Medisch Centrum Utrecht (Q97534164)

For the following (also with no ROR id) there's just one lower level organization that has a ROR id, and the name is substantially the same as the network, so I think the best solution is to move the ROR id to the top level (within Wikidata) and make any adjustments to name/location or other metadata within  ROR that may be needed to be clear about what the ROR identifies:
* Admiraal de Ruyterziekenhuis (Q36423003) - ROR 04r0k8112
* Albert Schweitzer Ziekenhuis (Q97383147) -  ROR 00e8ykd54

comment_text: For the new ID's, I inserted the bulk request form into the Google sheet I created (linked above); the ""New ID's"" tab has the list of records we should probably add to ROR. One of them I decided should not be added however - ""Santiz"" was dissolved at the beginning of  2021 so should not be needed any longer.
