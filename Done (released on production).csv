comment_text: I added the ISNI for this research institute; they have a slightly different English version of the name - ""Biomedical Research Network Centre in Respiratory Diseases"", maybe that should be another alias?

Also note that the type for the sibling organizations is listed as ""Facility""; that may be more appropriate than ""government"" here, I think we generally use ""Facility"" for research institutes like this one.

And yes, this should definitely be in ROR.

comment_text: Per organization website (https://www.hereon.de/innovation_transfer/communication_media/news/100319/index.php.en): ""Today the Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht – Centre for Materials and Coastal Research GmbH has been renamed the Helmholtz-Zentrum hereon GmbH."" Organization name in ROR should be updated. Not sure if primary name should be updated to ""Helmholtz-Zentrum hereon GmbH"" or ""Helmholtz-Zentrum hereon"" (sans ""GmbH""). News release includes the GmbH but other data sources such as organization's main webpage, Wikipedia, ISNI do not include the GmbH. Moving to Needs discussion.

The website link at ROR still resolves, but has also been updated and should be changed to ""https://www.hereon.de/index.php.en""

comment_text: I think we would generally leave out the GmbH in the main name, but the new full name with that included should be added as an alias. If you search ror.org right now for 'GmbH' you'll find many matches but only a small fraction include the 'GmbH' in the main display name. We maybe should have a policy on this, but generally I think ""co."", ""ltd."", ""AB"" etc. legal-entity-type suffixes should probably go in aliases as a general rule, not in the main name we display unless the organization always includes that part of their official name.

However, the existing link in the ROR record (http://www.pntu.com.ua/) resolves to a site where the old name is still present (Poltava National Technical University).

But yes it is clearly the same university - the address is identical, and the same ""Yuri Kondratyuk"" is there on the old website at least on this page: http://www.pntu.com.ua/university/scientific-technical-library/ which uses the name ""Poltava National Technical Yuri Kondratyuk University"". I'm guessing the old website is still there because it's in English (and http not https?)
So I agree with the above recommended change. Also maybe we should add the Ukrainian official name (from the new website): Національний університет «Полтавська політехніка імені Юрія Кондратюка»

While those 3 principles (or others with the same name) have published research, none of them (that I could find on Google Scholar at least) used this organization as the affiliation. Also I don't see any other research outputs of this organization at the moment. I recommend we put this one on hold until 2022 and re-evaluate at that point.

comment_text: Definitely a medical research organization. The publication list link is for their self-published items and newsletters though. They seem to have subsidiaries in other African countries too (Uganda)? But I found a number of articles that use the South Africa organization as affiliations - example: https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(14)01249-1/abstract

So yes, let's add this.

comment_text: This looks good to me too! I'm wondering about the location. I went to check if they had a Ringgold ID, and I found 7 locations in South Africa with different Ringgold IDs/ISNIs:

Should we list all 7 Ringgold IDs/ISNIs under the same record? The ISNI provided is for the Richmond location, not Johannesburg--and it doesn't look like there is one for Johannesberg.

comment_text: I agree with the proposed changes here - the ISNI clearly refers to the Frankfurt, Germany location (there is also another ISNI for the international RISM organization but that doesn't belong on this record either) so the ISNI entry should be removed. I also made a note of the associated Wikidata ID for this Swiss office. I do wonder whether we should have another ROR id for the German office and/or the international organization, but if it hasn't been requested by anybody I suppose that's not urgent.

comment_text: Verified at Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_French_Antilles

> It [University of the French West Indies and Guiana] was previously part of a larger institution in combination with campuses in French Guiana known as the University of the French West Indies and Guiana. As a result of funding disputes, that university was separated into two distinct institutions based on its constituent parts in French Guiana and the Lesser Antilles respectively. The separation process was completed by 1 January 2015.

There is already en entry in ROR for University of French Guiana: https://ror.org/00nb39k71. Therefore, to make the registry current, we should rename the existing record for University of the French West Indies and Guiana. 

According to Wikipedia and the university website, I believe the name should be: University of the French Antilles (fr: Université des Antilles).

comment_text: I agree with Maria on what the new name should be (what is missing from ROR right now). As this is a split it seems like we should somehow deprecate this record and create a new one with the new name? But maybe just changing the name as proposed here is ok.

comment_text: This is a successor organization to the Finnish Food Safety Authority Evira, which was associated with grid.425556.5 and https://ror.org/01zmp8b44. 

GRID created a new record for the successor org, Finnish Food Authority, which corresponds to https://ror.org/00dpnza76 and https://grid.ac/institutes/grid.509946.7. 

The change to the website that was originally requested was to update the URL to [www.foodauthority.fi](http://www.foodauthority.fi/). This redirects to https://www.ruokavirasto.fi/, which is the URL we have in our metadata.

Therefore, the metadata that we currently have for the Finnish Food Authority (https://ror.org/00dpnza76) appears to be correct so this issue can be closed. I will update the ID in the issue title for clarity. When we do a comprehensive review of ROR IDs that need to be redirected as per merging performed by GRID, the prior ID https://ror.org/01zmp8b44 will be redirected.

They don't even have a Crossref Funder ID yet (not to mention any of the other ID's we look at).

comment_text: I work for NDRIO now and can speak to our context—we are definitely operational! NDRIO is already funding research activities (https://portagenetwork.ca/news/call-for-applications-ndrio-portage-covid-19-data-curation-funding/), with another funding opportunity imminent: https://engagedri.ca/pre-announcement-of-inaugural-funding-opportunity

NDRIO absorbed staff from the Canadian Association of Research Libraries' (https://ror.org/001tw8739) Portage Network (https://portagenetwork.ca/) on April 1, and will soon absorb staff from Compute Canada (https://ror.org/03ty8yr27). Our thinking is that since these organizations have ROR ids, we shouldn't lose that due to the merger.

In addition to NDRIO providing funding, NDRIO staff (including the Portage Network team, focused on research data management) produce research; the organization facilitates research activities, and we educate researchers through training. Here are publications for the Portage Network - https://zenodo.org/communities/portage-network/

Some comparable organizations internationally would be the Australian Research Data Commons (https://ror.org/038sjwq14) and JISC (https://ror.org/01rv9gx86), both of which have ROR ids.

Please let me know if you have further thoughts on this!

comment_text: Hi Kelly - great context on this, obviously I didn't realize you were involved! Do you know if NDRIO has contacted Crossref to create a funder id? You mention NDRIO ""absorbed staff"" from other organizations - do those other organizations still exist, or were they merged into NDRIO? It's not clear from any of the websites what the history is on this. But whether or not they were fully merged, I agree if people were publishing with a CARL/Portage Network etc. affiliation and are now with NDRIO and likely to publish with that affiliation that's a good reason to go ahead now.

Is there a reference document somewhere that explains the history and plans a bit?

comment_text: Hi Arthur - that's a good question, I will follow up on contacting Crossref! One complicating factor is that we anticipate a name change in the coming months (the _New_ Digital Research Infrastructure Organization was meant to be a placeholder). Crossref seems to use multiple DOIs to cover renaming (with the ""renamedAs""/""continuationOf"" relationship), so it may be easiest to defer? I went ahead with the ROR submission at the request of a colleague, who was submitting a manuscript, had to add her affiliation, and realized we didn't have a ROR yet. :) 

Yes, the Canadian Association of Research Libraries still exists--the Portage (RDM) team has just moved over. We were previously funded by NDRIO and employed by CARL; now we're directly employed by NDRIO. Not sure if adding Compute Canada will be more of a merger, or if they will continue to exist separately in some form.

This page from the Government of Canada is the clearest explanation: https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/136.nsf/eng/home along with this FAQ: https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/136.nsf/eng/00003.html.

comment_text: I appreciate all of the additional information from Kelly. I heard Mark Leggot's talk about NDRIO at RDA. Based on the ROR documentation and what I heard during the talk, I am supportive of assigning a ROR.

comment_text: @KellyStathis in the metadata record for NDRIO, should CARL, Compute Canada, and Portage be listed as child organizations? Or related organizations? (Or something else?)

Also - is it located in Ottawa or Toronto? (the website indicates an address in Toronto)

comment_text: @mariagould CARL and Compute Canada should not be listed as child or related organizations.

- CARL is fully separate from NDRIO
- Compute Canada will become part of NDRIO, but isn't yet
- Portage is fully under NDRIO, and would be a child organization if we had a ROR--but I don't think we do

One related organization to add would be ISED, who funds NDRIO: https://ror.org/03zp01h17

Ottawa is the official location.

Not in Wikidata/Wikipedia or ISNI. It seems to be very new? Not a huge team, but more than one person, and they are using CSCCE as an affiliation at least in their Zenodo documents. We might want to wait on this a bit though? Or go ahead and add it, either way is ok with me.

KBase is a free, open source data analysis and sharing platform funded by the Department of Energy to support research and education in systems biology and bioinformatics. KBase supports the movement towards FAIR data principles. For example, data sets and reproducible analysis workflows can received DOIs that can be included in publications.

KBase is a data analysis platform that allows users to combine data from many sources to do sophisticated analysis thru a free, open source, graphical user interface. I believe that unique research discoveries are enabled by our platform, and we are now able to produce static snap-shots of analysis workflows, which get a DOI and can be submitted in a publication, for example in a data availability statement. So, yes - included in publication metadata associated w the DOI for the data workflow. We would include the ROR ID directly into the DOI metadata, which would sync automatically with DataCite.

For several of us on the project that are still active researchers, we would also include the ROR ID in our ORCID accounts, for example. We are hoping, in a few years, to start enabling a post-doc program and possibly community grants to work with us, which could also utilize the affiliation ID.","mariagould

comment_text: Based on a quick scan I wondered if this was the same institution as the National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (https://ror.org/0405n5e57) (website in the ROR record does not resolve but should be https://nimhans.ac.in/). However, the URL provided in the new request is different (http://imhans.ac.in/), as is the location (Kerala vs Bengluru). Therefore I believe this is a different institution with a very similar name, and that we should create a new record in ROR.

comment_text: This one is a little confusing. 

- The name in the current ROR record is IK4-AZTERLAN. The requestor (a marketing manager from the organization) is requesting that the name be changed to AZTERLAN Metallurgy Research Centre. 
- ""Metallurgy Research Centre"" is a subtitle on the organization website but I am not seeing it prominently used elsewhere.
- Based on the first four publications listed on the website (http://www.azterlan.es/en/scientific-publications.html), the requested new name does not appear to be a common affiliation name. The publication examples use ""Azterlan"" or ""Fundación Azterlan.""

Based on the above, should we change the primary name to ""Azterlan"" and then add aliases for ""Azterlan Metallurgy Research Centre"",  ""Fundación Azterlan"", and ""IK4-Azterlan""?

comment_text: A few thoughts:
* AZTERLAN is always fully in upper-case (on their website and also in affiliations in publications), I think we  should follow that
* We may also want to add the Basque ('eu' language code) name ""AZTERLAN Metalurgia Ikerketa Zentroa"" and Spanish ('es') ""AZTERLAN Centro de Investigación Metalúrgica"".
* There's a Wikidata entry - https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30267191 and also a LinkedIn company page: https://www.linkedin.com/company/ik4-azterlan/ which states the full name as ""AZTERLAN Metallurgy Research Centre""

However, I agree that the ""AZTERLAN Metallurgy Research Centre"" name has not appeared as an affiliation in publications yet. So I think what you suggest is fine, except we should capitalize AZTERLAN in all instances and add the Spanish and Basque full names. Make sense?

I have verified this usage of name in English on the university website. I have checked Google Scholar but do not see any example articles using the shortened version. (I do not have access to WoS). 

My question is, is it appropriate for ROR to use the shortened version of the English and Polish names?

comment_text: The English wikipedia page uses their preferred short name: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igor_Sikorsky_Kyiv_Polytechnic_Institute
It also uses an even more abbreviated name of just ""Kyiv Polytechnic Institute"" in the infobox on the right; that was apparently the official name 1992–1995 according to the article there.

There are English affiliations that use an acronym for the first part of the full name - 'NTUU “Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute”' (see https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304885318329342). However I also didn't find any with  just their preferred version.

Here's what I recommend so people searching for the full name or other versions will find this:
* Replace the primary name entry with their preferred English name
* Add all the various versions of the name as aliases or alternate language versions - that includes both Polish versions, the current primary name,  NTUU “Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute”, Kyiv Polytechnic Institute, and any other versions that make sense.
* Also add acronym versions: ""NTUU KPI"" and ""KPI""

comment_text: I think this is in scope for ROR and should be added. ROR already includes other state geological surveys (e.g. Arizona, Utah). Note that the NCGS has a parent organization in ROR (the NC DEQ), however it is also an organization/affiliation on its own.

One question - the submission mentions the ""NCGS Coastal Plain Office and Core Repository"", which looks like an office within the NCGS: https://deq.nc.gov/about/divisions/energy-mineral-land-resources/north-carolina-geological-survey/contact-us#Geological_Survey. I am not sure if we should include this as an alias/alternate name or not, since it is a subdivision? Either way, I think the NCGS should be added; this is a question for the metadata preparation.

comment_text: Their publications list is self-published stuff, so not really academic journals, though they are data providers so maybe that would be enough anyway. However, I did find some papers where this is used as an affiliation - for example https://progearthplanetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40645-015-0062-5 -  author Kathleen M. Farrell. 

Also I could not find it in any of our standard databases (Wikidata, ISNI, etc.) ISNI does have https://isni.org/isni/0000000090078338 - but that appears to refer to their ""Bulletin"" and not the organization itself. So this would be new with us.

Anyway, I agree we should add this one.

Is it used as a research affiliation? Reports published on the site itself use it as an affiliation; I'm not sure about other publications though. It sounds like what they do is legal research, so i think it should qualify?

In both cases these do not appear to be used as an affiliation, but they are cited as funders (despite not having a Crossref Funder ID) - for example https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.601901/full states ""Funding was provided by ... the Beaufort Lagoon Ecosystems Long Term Ecological Research program (BLE LTER) under NSF award 1656026.""

comment_text: I lean toward adding to ROR. The organization is not already in ROR, it has it's own domain, more than one person, is involved with research, there are similar orgs in ROR, but I'm not sure how much the organization is being used as an affiliation. The DOIs provided do not use as an affiliation, but I did find reports that the organization put out - https://www.icsm.gov.au/publications.

comment_text: [Comments from Arthur] The sample repository is a facility, not an organization used as an affiliation. However, I don't think we have a ROR for the associated organization - ""Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center"", part of US Geological Survey. The ""Woods Hole Research Center"" in ROR right now appears to be a different organization, recently renamed the ""Woodwell Climate Research Center"". There is also the ""Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution"" which does have a ROR, but that's an independent nonprofit. So I think we need to add a ROR for the Woods Hole Coastal and Marine Science Center - also there may be other USGS research centers like this  that should also be added.

comment_text: This is related to the request in #63. Additional information from the requestor about the relationship between the two entities and the interest in having ROR IDs for both:

> OpenCitations is distinct from and pre-existed the Research Centre, having grown to become a valuable independent infrastructure from a small beginning as a research project in my lab.

> The Research Centre was created specifically for two purposes: (a) to provide an institutional affiliation, a legal financial centre, and a formal administrative 'home' for OpenCitations, and (b) to permit academic activities affiliated with OpenCitations, such as being the academic home for graduate students of the University of Bologna working on projects involving open citations.  The Research Centre is formally a part of the University of Bologna in a way that OpenCitations is not.

> In the medium-term future, OpenCitations may 'spin out' to become a non-profit foundation /association/Stiftung under direct governance by the wider academic community and other stakeholders, that is administratively and financially independent from the University of Bologna.  In that case, OpenCitations will continue with its stated mission of providing open bibliographic metadata and citations, and the Research Centre will continue as an integral part of the University of Bologna in its academic roles with respect to OpenCitations, and will probably by then also have expanded its activities to include other types of metadata-oriented research work, but it will no longer be administratively and financially responsible for OpenCitations.

comment_text: Clearly a significant research-involved organization; however I have not been able to find any publications using ""Microscopy Australia"" as an affiliation. There are lots of papers which acknowledge use of its resources, but it doesn't seem to be what (any?) authors consider themselves to belong to. This seems similar to the MagIC case which I thought needed further discussion. However somebody else can also weigh in. Other than the lack of use as an affiliation, I think this would be clearly suitable for adding to ROR.

comment_text: Interesting case where this is a network on microscope facilities that can be used by Australian researchers. The microscopes seem to be at university that would already have ROR IDs. Since it is being acknowledged in publications, it may make sense to assign a ROR since it fits other criteria - more than one parent organization (network of universities), independent domain, run by more than one person, established/stable.

comment_text: Further information from the organization. Note that I have added MicroAU to the acronym in the summary data above.

> Microscopy Australia is a network of microscopy facilities that are hosted at universities. We provide funding for infrastructure and personnel. As a result, researchers acknowledge Microscopy Australia for support in their publications but there is no researcher affiliated with Microscopy Australia per se. In the Australian research environment, Microscopy Australia is the same type of research facility as the Australian National Imaging Facility (NIF, https://ror.org/01kdbsa35) and AuScope (https://ror.org/04s1m4564).
> 
> Acronym/abbreviation: in the application, I wrote “n/a”. In the GitHub board, it is “MA”. If an acronym were to be used, I would prefer “MicroAU” instead of “MA”. Microscopy Australia has recommended that researchers and partners (in Australia and overseas) do not use “MA” when referring to Microscopy Australia. If anything, in Australia, “MA” is “Metabolomics Australia”.

comment_text: Not listed in any of our standard databases. It appears to be entirely part of one of the departments at the University of British Columbia; website is also under that domain. Papers I have found with this as an affiliation always list it as something like ""PCIGR, Department of ..., University of British Columbia"". So it does not qualify as an independent top-level organization - University of British Columbia should be used. I think this is a clear no given our guidelines.

The centre has separate branding from the university, there are other similar organizations in ROR, it is established, and run by more than one person.

comment_text: We have other state ""Geological Survey"" organizations, but I'm not sure on this one. No Wikidata or Wikipedia links to be found. Acronym is DGMR.

There is an ISNI for ""Geological Survey of Virginia"" - https://isni.org/isni/0000000101032918 but that is an old name for this organization which has had several names and department changes. History here: https://www.dmme.virginia.gov/dgmr/history.shtml

They do provide research data and a sample repository; I can't find any regular research publication using this as an affiliation though. There are definitely old publications using the ""Virginia Geological Survey"" or other names for it as affiliation. So I think it clearly qualifies if we consider its history in full? The parent department (Virginia Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy) also has no ROR but I don't think creating one for that would be preferable in this case, as the DGMR has a longer history than its ""parent"".

Anyway, leaning towards yes on this, but another opinion would be good!

I'm leaning in the same direction--that we should consider the history in full, along with the fact that it is a state Geological Survey (and therefore we have other similar organizations in ROR).

This is the same name given on the Wikipedia page (see sidebar): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kharkiv_National_Academy_of_Municipal_Economy

I would suggest:
- change the name as indicated to ""O.M. Beketov National University of Urban Economy in Kharkiv""
- add the alias ""O.M. Beketov Kharkiv National University of Municipal Economy"" (alternate English version of new name from website/wikipedia)
- add the alias ""Kharkiv National Academy of Municipal Economy"" (previous name in English)

We have already the name in Ukranian as a label: ""Харківський національний університет міського господарства"". This matches the first part of the name from the website footer, ""Харківський національний університет міського господарства імені О. М. Бекетова"". I'm not sure if we need to also update the Ukranian label to add ""О. М. Бекетова""?

comment_text: Agreed, from the website it appears to be something different than the current name indicates. However, the English name on the website is ""Junior College Library Association"", so we should probably prefer that name for the main label/English name?
The Japanese name we have also appears to be incorrect - from the website the name in Japanese I believe should be:
私立短期大学図書館協議会
(which is ""Private Junior College Library Council"" from Google Translate - is that where you got that English name?)
The Wikidata ID in any case is what points to the library college that came to an end in 1980, which is presumably where the person suggesting the problem discovered this, so we should remove that Wikidata ID also.

comment_text: The request seems to have some confusion about our display/use of names - IMS is an acronym in our data, even though it's displayed along with the Japanese name. I'm assuming what they really want is to modify the Japanese name, and the requested change there would be to add the string ""国立研究開発法人"" (Google translates this as ""Japanese National Research and Development Agency"") at the front, and slightly modify the last part ""生命医科学研究センタ"" to ""生命医科学研究センター"" (Google translates both as ""Biomedical Science Research Center""). If we just change the name in Japanese along these lines I think that's fine, it does appear to be the more complete official name (see https://www.riken.jp/research/labs/ims/index.html).

comment_text: Reading the Dutch pages (with Google Translate) it seems clear the Netherlands Cancer Institute is a research institute while Antoni van Leeuwenhoekziekenhuis is a hospital, so they are (somewhat) distinct. They both have wikipedia pages: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoni_van_Leeuwenhoekziekenhuis and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_Cancer_Institute - and both together make up the ""NKI-AVL"" which could  have yet another separate organization identifier if we were to split them. Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be a main website for the combined organization. I think it might be best to change the main label here to ""Netherlands Cancer Institute-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital"" representing that joint organization. It would be nice if we could link to both websites, but if not I don't think it matters which one we pick. So basically yes I agree with Maria's recommendation here.

comment_text: I searched through wikimedia, ISNI and Crossref and they indeed seem not to be listed in any of those. Website is under the university's domain; affiliations of staff in publications also always seem to include the university as well. Searching Google scholar I could not find any cases of acknowledgement of the facility that didn't also include a staff member as one of the co-authors. So I think this does not meet our criteria for an independent top-level research organization.

Although these facilities may be hosted at a university, they function more autonomously from the university than a typical department. Other examples in ROR include Ocean Networks Canada (https://ror.org/05gknh003), hosted at the University of Victoria, and Canadian Light Source (https://ror.org/001bvc968), at the University of Saskatchewan. 

Since this facility is considered national, I think it is sufficiently independent from McMaster and meets our criteria for inclusion in ROR. Moving to ""Needs discussion"".

The new institute name is being used as an affiliation in publications, e.g., https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2020.126103.

My recommendation is that we add the prior names Institute of Research in Nanoscience of Aragon and Aragón Materials Science Institute as aliases to the existing record.

comment_text: In the ROR API, 'KANTABRIAKO UNIBERTSITATEA' is listed as a Basque (eu) version of the name, and 'UNIVERSITAT DE CANTÀBRIA' as a Catalan (ca) version. I'm assuming from this message that these are unofficial or unapproved versions of the name. I don't think they add much to discoverability, though they are used on Basque and Catalan websites referring to the university. Anyway, I think it's fine to remove them here. We do have a policy of using the English name (if there is an official one) as the main label in ROR so I think we should leave that. And ""UC"" is probably not much use as an acronym so fine to remove that also.

So - just remove all the aliases and other-language labels except for Spanish, and leave the rest alone. Make sense?

The ""Link to publications"" is a journal they produce, ""Identidad Bolivariana"" which seems to contain a selection of articles from various universities in South America.

comment_text: Right now the requested ""Keldysh Institute of Applied Mathematics of Russian Academy of Sciences"" is included as an alias, so that can be left alone. Also we already have the acronym ""KIAM RAS"" so leave that as well. I believe we should also leave the shorter English acronym ""KIAM"" but I guess they're requesting it be removed. I don't think it hurts to leave it.

So I think the changes this is requesting is to remove the current Russian label:
- Институт прикладной математики им. М. В. Келдыша РАН
and replace it with 
- Федеральное государственное учреждение ""Федеральный исследовательский центр Институт прикладной математики им. М.В. Келдыша Российской академии наук""

and then also to add another Russian label (or acronym?):

- ИПМ им. М.В. Келдыша РАН

The current Russian label is about half way between those two, so I guess it's fine to remove it and replace with these. Anyway this change seems straightforward and the institute is requesting it so I recommend going ahead.

comment_text: The Wikidata ID is no longer valid - it was deleted for lack of supporting information. This is a very small publisher from Pakistan, with 2 journals focused on business management questions. I guess this may count as research publications but it seems out of scope relative to our main focus. Unless we really want to have a complete database of scholarly publishers I don't think this needs to be included in ROR. Willing to listen to a second opinion on this though.

comment_text: I think we need more clarity in our policies to decide this. Do publishers need to be a certain size for inclusion? Generally, I think publishers and journals are better covered by other databases (like Sherpa Romeo). That said, per our our [Guidance for Evaluating Common Organization Types](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/wiki/Curator-Evaluation-Workflow:-New-Records#guidance-for-evaluating-common-organization-types), publishers are generally in scope for ROR: ""Add to ROR if: **publishing/hosting research**, and/or if members publish research using this affiliation."" Moving to ""Needs discussion"".

I wonder how many other id's have this problem. Anyway, the ""soft hyphen"" character definitely should be removed - just rewriting the word ""Research"" maybe would solve this if it's hard to see the problem in the editing UI.

comment_text: They definitely have research publications where this is used as an affiliation - the linked publication seems to be a dataset; another example as a regular article is https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.7022 . The one question I have is the degree of separation between this and the Tula Foundation for which we already have a ROR id (and which is acknowledged as a research funder in itself). Tula seems to be their only source of funds and so is in a sense a top-level organization for Hakai - however when used as an affiliation, Tula doesn't seem to be mentioned, and the website is independent. So I lean towards creating a separate ROR id for Hakai Institute, but I'm not completely certain on this.

comment_text: The Tula Foundation funds several projects, one of which is The Hakai Institute. Most staff scientists and research technicians would say they work for the Hakai Institute rather than the Tula Foundation. The Hakai Institute is more recognizable as an organization based on the work we publish as opposed to the Tula Foundation. 

Currently, there is no way to affiliate our work with the Hakai Institute in DataCite Metadata Schema for example. We've been using Tula as our affiliation there, but as you'll see most researchers note their affiliation in research papers to the Hakai Institute and then acknowledge the Tula Foundation as the funder.

It is a slightly odd scenario I gather, but I spoke with our President Dr. Eric Peterson on this matter specifically and he is OK with using Hakai as our Research Organization and Tula as the funder as this logically represents how the two organizations are related.

Hope this helps! Happy to provide more context if necessary.

The garden's email addresses are @vgregion.se, but I wasn't able to find a reference to the Gothenburg Botanic Garden on the parent organization's website (https://www.vgregion.se/). I think they are sufficiently independent.

Other information about this request: Description of Repository: The spinal cord injury (SCI) community created the ODC-SCI to mitigate dark data in SCI research. The ODC-SCI also aims to increase transparency with individual-level data, enhance collaboration, facilitate advanced analytics, and conform to increasing mandates by funders and publishers to make data accessible. Members of the ODC-SCI have access to a private digital lab space managed by the PI or multi-PIs for dataset storage and sharing. The PIs can share their labs’ datasets with the registered members of the ODC-SCI community and make their datasets public and citable. The ODC-SCI implements stewardship principles that scientific data be made FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) and has been widely adopted by the international SCI research community.","KellyStathis

comment_text: This is a data repository for spinal cord injury research. Data repositories are in scope for ROR if they are actively publishing/disseminating research, which is the case for ODC-SCI. It is a collaborative effort between UC San Francisco and the University of Alberta: https://www.ualberta.ca/rehabilitation/news-and-events/news/2019/august/first-global-open-data-commons-for-preclinical-spinal-cord-injury-research-will-be-a-game-changer.html. The submission also indicates it is hosted at UCSD. However, I think it is sufficiently standalone that it is in scope for ROR on its own, with these universities as related organizations.

- is an established organization
- is a top-level organization and not a subsidiary unit
- is associated with research publications and/or other activities:
  - they publish the journal Andalucia en la Historía (see https://www.centrodeestudiosandaluces.es/publicaciones/cat/revista-andalucia-en-la-historia, https://portal.issn.org/resource/ISSN/1695-1956)

comment_text: While they list a number of people as staff at the company, the only person I've found using this affiliation is the founder, Ben Dichter, and then only on a handful of papers/preprints/datasets (via google scholar at least). I think this should probably wait for a ROR id until they have a more substantive need for it.

comment_text: Responding to @cfuentemo - I don't think we can add Ringgold ID's in ROR, but it could be linked perhaps by adding that to the Wikidata record. I did add the English name you suggest to the list of ""other names"".

In general - this is a newly established independent private university in Spain, but it developed over a number of years previously through a link with the Complutense University of Madrid. It has some level of research activity and use as an affiliation (Google Scholar finds many papers with this). So it certainly seems to me to qualify for inclusion in ROR.

comment_text: State scientific and research institution focused on Ukrainian law, and also part of the National Academy of Legal Sciences of Ukraine. A couple of questions:

-The organization appears to have two parents: the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine (https://ror.org/00je4t102) and the National Academy of Legal Sciences of Ukraine (not represented in ROR, but should probably be added given https://ror.org/001040111 and https://ror.org/042dnf796). It seems as sufficiently independent, from the affiliation usage, but I think others should weigh in.

https://www.nas.gov.ua/EN/Org/Pages/default.aspx?OrgID=0000661

-For the primary name, there are varying English representations. Should this be what the requestor has provided, or the full form that appears on publications, ""The Academician F. H. Burchak Scientific-Research Institute of Private Law and Entrepreneurship of National Academy of Law Sciences of Ukraine""?

comment_text: Hi Adam - other than in the request form, where did you see that this was part of the ""National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine"" (for which we have a ROR id)? Everywhere I look on this, including in the full affiliation names, it seems to be just part of the ""National Academy of Legal Sciences of Ukraine"". I agree that should be in ROR, and I think this should be also, given how we handle other institutes of national academies. Also I think we generally don't use those ""full form"" names as main labels, but it could be an alternate label.

Anyway, other than the relationship to https://ror.org/00je4t102 as a parent organization, I think this is ready to be added here.

comment_text: Yes, agreed it should be in ROR.
I think the established date should be 2005; however it was formed by joining two previously existing data centres - BADC and NEODC, with BADC having a long history (and an ISNI id:  ISNI 0000 0004 5900 5324). Also their history page goes back to 1984: https://www.ceda.ac.uk/about/history/ But 2005 seems to be when the current name was taken on (or close to the current name) so maybe that's the best date to set here. If we need one.

comment_text: We definitely need to fix the main label here. Looking through Google Scholar, the acronym IZA has been used as part of this affiliation for many years - here's one from 1999: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=165870
where it is phrased as ""IZA Institute of Labor Economics"". The request here includes a '-' character, but I don't actually see that anywhere on the iza.org website, it is always (in English) referred to either as IZA, or in the header format with a large IZA followed directly by ""Institute of Labor Economics"".

As to the German name, the website header in German is the same as in English, with the English version of the name. So that should definitely be our primary label here. We already have the same German name as in this request except without the ""GmbH"" or parenthetical IZA piece; generally we don't add GmbH's to our German labels, and IZA is there as an acronym so I think we should leave the German version of the name alone.

So the only change I think should be made here is to the primary (English) label which I believe should be:
""IZA Institute of Labor Economics""

comment_text: I agree with Arthur's assessment. My only question is whether we should add ""Institute for the Study of Labor"" as an alias - I don't see this on their official website, but that comes up as an alternate name for IZA from a few other sources ([Wikidata page](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q317269), [DDI Alliance](https://ddialliance.org/project/institute-for-the-study-of-labor-iza-international-data-service-center-idsc). I wonder if it is an alternate translation of the German that has stuck?

I'm not sure which category this falls under within the [Guidance for evaluating common organization types](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/wiki/Curator-Evaluation-Workflow:-New-Records#guidance-for-evaluating-common-organization-types). 

However, there are similar non-profit organizations in ROR, for example the [Council of Science Editors](https://ror.org/007cr8911), which has [partnered with ABEC Brasil](https://www.councilscienceeditors.org/resource-library/cse-publication-certificate-program/cse-publication-certificate-program-for-abec-members/). Based on this, I think ABEC Brasil is in scope for ROR. They are an established organization and closely related to research activities.

Change to ""https"" vs ""http"" makes sense from a privacy/security standpoint and the ""http"" form redirects there anyway.

comment_text: Radio astronomy facility associated with Paris Observatory and University of Orleans. Data outputs and related research appear to use Paris Observatory affiliation (e.g., https://archives-decametriques.obspm.fr/?lang=en ;  https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224263728_Solar_physics_at_Nancay_radio_observatory_Recent_developments/link/02bfe510a23f96bbb9000000/download), but we have lots of other observatories in ROR. Should be in scope, per the tracking research outputs and funding acknowledgment use cases in #49 and #386. Multiple parents as well.

comment_text: Yes the website link  should be trimmed as suggested.

However, I don't understand quite what is being proposed regarding labels. From their website, the German name of this institute appears now to be:
""Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik
Deutsches Institut für Internationale Politik und Sicherheit""
(from their Contact page, and also the header on every page)

However the *English* page lists the name they seem to  be requesting, so perhaps this is the official English name?:
""Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik
German Institute for International and Security Affairs""
SWP is an acronym so  I don't think should be part of the main label at all.

Therefore I believe we should change:
* Primary label: ""Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, German Institute for International and Security Affairs""
* Label  in German: ""Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, Deutsches Institut für Internationale Politik und Sicherheit""
and leave the acronym as it is.

@MSpenger do you agree?

comment_text: Going by their English ""about"" page - https://www.rj.se/en/about-rj2/ the English name they use is ""Riksbankens Jubileumsfond"", with abbreviation ""RJ"". The Swedish name we have seems what they use on the Swedish version of that page (""Stiftelsen Riksbankens Jubileumsfond""). Their request regarding ""For the advancement of the Humanities and Social sciences"" seems confused - unless they consider it part of a full official name (for example we could add ""Riksbankens Jubileumsfond For the advancement of the Humanities and Social sciences"" as an alternate label I guess) I don't think we have a place for logo text like that in ROR.

So I recommend replacing the primary label with their English label ""Riksbankens Jubileumsfond"", retaining the Swedish label, adding ""RJ' as an acronym, and keeping the former primary label as another alternate label.

comment_text: I'm not sure about removing the word ""Stiftelsen"" because it doesn't appear on the English version on the website. Arguments for including it:

- From what I can tell, ""Stiftelsen"" (which means ""foundation"") is part of their official Swedish name - they may have just thought it was awkward or redundant to translate on the English side? I wouldn't attribute too much significance to that omission. I'm not seeing evidence that ""Riksbankens Jubileumsfond"" an official ""English"" name - particularly because it's still Swedish! I think it's just a short name.
- The word ""Foundation"" is already part of their current English translated name in ROR.
- There are other Swedish foundations in ROR that keep the word ""Stiftelsen"": https://ror.org/search?query=stiftelsen

My proposal:
- primary name: use the full name, ""Stiftelsen Riksbankens Jubileumsfond""
- alias/label: ""Riksbankens Jubileumsfond"" - if added as a label, I would say it is Swedish for language, not English
- label: ""Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation"" (English)
- acronyms: ""RJ""

For the request on ""For the advancement of the Humanities and Social sciences"", I think they might be referring to the alias we have, ""The Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences"" - we are missing the word ""Advancement"". Not sure if we should update this alias or remove it, if we don't normally include taglines like this?

comment_text: Agree with Kelly's proposal, with one caveat - I don't think we need to add ""Riksbankens Jubileumsfond"" as an alias or label. It's a substring of the primary name and we don't typically include those as alternate forms. Searching this substring by itself would already returns the full ""Stiftelsen Riksbankens Jubileumsfond"" name in the API and site. You can see this now by searching for just ""Sweden Tercentenary"" and returning https://ror.org/02jkbm893.

comment_text: Looking at the [guidance for common organization types](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/wiki/Curator-Evaluation-Workflow:-New-Records#guidance-for-evaluating-common-organization-types), we specify that for a museum within a university, ""Add to ROR if: they are producing research and the museum is used as an affiliation."" I agree that the  museum by itself is not used as an affiliation - for example, the museum director uses his university affiliation on his ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1259-3363 

However, this feels like a fine line that we're drawing here. The example in the guidance is the UC Berkeley Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (https://ror.org/01rdg4502) - I'm not sure if the difference between these two examples is significant:
- The [UCMVZ website](https://mvz.berkeley.edu/) is also hosted within the UC Berkeley domain, and although it doesn't mention a department, it is a [research unit within the university](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/research-units?for=All&search=&rut=All&page=4).
- Both museums are listed in GBIF: [UCMVZ](https://www.gbif.org/grscicoll/institution/59175240-4500-42b9-9e98-42ae299a5e9b/metrics), [Lund University Biological Museum](https://www.gbif.org/grscicoll/institution/13edc77b-7023-4ddd-89c7-d883a480b294)

I do agree that this is not a top-level organization; however, I want to make sure we are consistent. Moving to ""needs discussion"".

comment_text: Unfortunately, this request isn't as simple as an ISNI change. The current URL in the ROR record points to the University of the French Antilles. The Wikidata ID (https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q829169) points at the University of the French West Indies and Guiana, which appears to have been split into to different entities in 2015 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_French_Antilles). 

So, we need to make a determination if this record represents the historic form of the organization before it split, deprecate it, and create a new record to reflect the University of the French Antilles entry (with the updated ISNI), or pursue some other kind of representation.

comment_text: There is some backstory to the organization's history in #192. The records we have in ROR currently reflect the fact that University of the French West Indies and Guiana split into two entities in 2015:

University of the French West Indies: https://ror.org/02ryfmr77
University of French Guiana: https://ror.org/00nb39k71

GRID renamed https://ror.org/02ryfmr77 last year. It looks like the older name was stripped from the metadata. I would recommend that we add it as an alias. 

I think the current records are sufficient as far as representation is concerned. 

The main task is to sort out the external IDs:

ISNI: I'm not actually sure that the requestor's suggested ISNI for University of the French West Indies is accurate. It looks like this one might be the primary: https://isni.org/isni/0000000494712972. Perhaps @arthurpsmith can confirm? If this is the case, I would recommend that we go with https://isni.org/isni/0000000494712972 as the ""preferred"" ID and list the requestor's suggestion and the one currently in the record (http://isni.org/isni/0000000121973053) in ""all."" 

Wikidata: The Wikidata ID we currently have indicates that it has been replaced by https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16682075 so we should update the ROR metadata accordingly. We could include the older Wikidata ID in ""all.""

comment_text: Hmm, I get the impression this is a very small organization (the website claims only 2 employees who don't appear to be engaged in research) so I'm not sure how the cited affiliations apply. However, it does appear to be a funder of research, and somehow at least two different researchers are claiming it as an affiliation in publications (note the ORCID relationship is as a ""member"" of the organization, which seems different from a research affiliation). So while it's not in the Crossref funders database I think this still should be listed in ROR. Moving to ""ready"".

comment_text: The affiliation stated in the medRxiv paper I looked at was ""Patient-Led Research for COVID-19"" which is slightly different than the requested name (and what's currently on the website). So if we add this that should be listed as another name. Note that they don't have a listed place of operation or headquarters, which I guess will come when they are actually registered in some way as an organization? But I don't see a need to delay on this; let's add it to ROR and update when they are more established.

I guess they haven't fully updated the English portion of the website, except to change the title used at the top of the page to ""Dnipro University of Technology"", which is what we should go with for the English (and main) label here. But we should add the official Ukrainian name also.

I.e. I recommend to replace the name with ""Dnipro University of Technology"", add ""National Mining University of Ukraine"" as an alias, and add ""Національний технічний університет «Дніпровська політехніка»"" as the Ukrainian name.

comment_text: Note that the name recommended by MG is slightly different than the one they requested. The ""research network"" part of the name seems to be dropped in most places on their website (both in Polish and English) except for the address section at the bottom of the page. For example on the English about page here: https://iw.lukasiewicz.gov.pl/en/home/aboutus/ it refers to itself as ""ŁUKASIEWICZ – The Textile Research Institute"". 
So I think both names should be added; the longer one is fine as the main name entry, but the shorter one should be there as an alias. I.e., agree with above but also add:
* Alternate name (English) ""Łukasiewicz - Textile Research Institute""
* Alternate name (Polish) ""Łukasiewicz - Instytut Włókiennictwa""

comment_text: I've looked through several publications referencing MagIC and as far as I can tell it is NOT used as an affiliation by the authors, rather they list just their home universities (UCSD or OSU, see the ""core group"" on their about page). They don't use Earthref either as an affiliation, so I don't think going to that level helps the case.

Going by our curation policy document for the in-scope questions:
* Yes it is involved in research in some way (providing software and data services for that community)
* No, I don't see it used as an affiliation in existing publications
* I don't see the members of the consortium using it as an affiliation
* Domain name is not standalone (but we don't have earthref.org either as noted above)
* Do we have similar organizations already? Maybe - Qualitative Data Repository: https://ror.org/014trz974 or IRIS consortium - https://ror.org/05xkn9s74
* Yes, it's definitely a consortium with multiple people involved at multiple institutions
* Copyright statement references Earthref.org and not MagIC specifically
* It's been around since 2003 so appears stable and well-established, though dependent on NSF funding
* Yes there are multiple parents.

So it meets about 1/2 our criteria. Is the lack of use as an affiliation disqualifying? I'm not sure on this one. Maybe this needs more discussion?

comment_text: Good question on it being an independent entity. According to this page: https://nau.edu.ua/ua/menu/un%D1%96versitet/polozhennya-srukturnih-pidrozdiliv.html
it is one of the ""separate structural subdivisions"" which includes a museum and some ""colleges"" and an ""academy"". The museum has a wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ukraine_State_Aviation_Museum which suggests it is quite independent (no ROR for it though). I also looked at one of the colleges: https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%B8%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BA%D1%96%D0%B2%D1%81%D1%8C%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B6_%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%86%D1%96%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%B0%D0%B2%D1%96%D0%B0%D1%86%D1%96%D0%B9%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D1%83%D0%BD%D1%96%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%83 - it existed independently for a time before becoming part of the NAU, so again somewhat independent but not really now.

Given that the area of expertise for this institute (design and ergonomics) seems quite separate from the aviation emphasis of the university as a whole, it seems to me justifiable to give this one its own ROR. But I'd be ok with a decision to just use the parent university ROR for this also. Note that I can't find it in Wikidata or ISNI.

And both seem to agree on ""Gromov Flight Research Institute"" as the English form of the name. The institute website doesn't have an English page so I don't know what they think about this version of the name, but I think we should make that the primary name, move the current primary name to an alias, and yes definitely remove the garbled 'JSC ""LII them MMGromova""' alias!

1. Add alias `Krivoy Rog State Pedagogical Institute`

comment_text: Hi all - it turns out we already have a ROR for this, but the main label is  different? https://ror.org/01wx1q736 - if you search on the website, or the Ukrainian name or English abbreviation (KDPU) it shows up! 

If you go to the English version of their website - https://kdpu.edu.ua/en/ - the name shown is indeed ""Kryvyi Rih State Pedagogical University"". Therefore I believe the changes needed to the existing ROR https://ror.org/01wx1q736 are:
* Make ""Kryvyi Rih State Pedagogical University"" the main name we use
* Move the current main name to an alias (while it may be a poor translation presumably it came from somewhere that still uses it?)
* Add the Ukrainian acronym КДПУ

comment_text: Cleaning up the details of this change (will paste a summary in the issue body as well):

The prior primary name in the record was ""Krivoy Rog State Pedagogical Institute"". The name was adjusted in GRID to be Kryvyi Rih State Pedagogical University. This change was synced to ROR in our final release. Per Wikipedia, Krivoy Rog is an alternate name for Kryvyi Rih (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kryvyi_Rih). 

The primary name in ROR is now up to date. There are two changes we should make to the existing record:

1. Add alias `Krivoy Rog State Pedagogical Institute`
2. Add Ukrainian acronym `КДПУ`

comment_text: This seems straightforward given the reference to the new English version of the name. We should also add the official Ukrainian name which I've attached to the main description above. However, there seems to be some disagreement on transliteration of Ukrainian 'Г' characters into English as 'H' or 'G' - Google Translate and other sources seem to insist that it's ""T.G. Shevchenko"", not ""T. H."", and that it  should be ""Collegium"", not ""Colehium"". Wikipedia has the poet's name as 'Taras Hryhorovych Shevchenko' though which implies sticking with the 'H'. So let's leave it this way I guess.

Note that the request to add ""Science"" to the organization type is not one of the allowed values; I'm not sure if there's something else they are trying to convey there. Since they use it in this communication I think  we should add DNURT as an acronym;  otherwise their list of alternate labels and acronyms looks  ok to me.

comment_text: I do not think these are the same organization, although they are clearly related:
https://ansgarhoyskole.no/om-skolen/skolens-organisering
The existing ""Bibelskole"" website does not redirect to the ""ansgarhoyskole.no"" site, it seems to be continuing under that name.
It may be they want to create a new ROR id for the ""University College"". Or maybe all ""Ansgar"" should be replaced by a top-level organization, but I'm not sure what. Here's the Google translate English version of the central portion of the ""organisering"" page, which I am having trouble making sense of:

""From 1 January 2006, Ansgar University College is registered as a subsidiary of Ansgar Høgskole AS under the limited liability group Ansgarskolen AS, which is also registered in the Brønnøysund registers from the same date. The limited liability group consists of the four companies Ansgar høyskole AS, Ansgar Drift og Eiendom AS, Ansgar bibelskole AS and Ansgar Sommerhotell AS. All shares in the group are owned by Misjonskirken Norge.""

Is the relevant top-level organization ""Ansgar Høgskole AS"", ""Ansgarskolen AS"" or perhaps just ""Misjonskirken Norge"" (the sponsoring church)?

Anyway, it seems clear that ""Ansgar Høgskole AS"", of which ""Ansgar University College"" is part, is different from ""Ansgar Bibelskole AS"", so  the substance of this request should not proceed as requested in my view, and something different needs to be done here. Just not sure what. Maybe go back to the requester for more detail on what the relationships are and what we should list?

comment_text: I'm seeing Ansgar University College used as an affiliation (e.g., https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/ijcm/2017/00000010/00000001/art00006). From what I can tell, the Bible school is a subsidiary and/or predecessor. Although the bible school website doesn't redirect to the university college site, the website footer does list https://ansgarhoyskole.no/ as the main contact. So I would recommend that we:

1. Update the primary name in the record to ""Ansgar University College""
2. Add ""Ansgar Bible School"" as an alias
3.  Add the Norwegian name ""Ansgar høyskole""
4. Add ""AS"" as an acronym

* Primary name: Leibniz Institute for Research and Information in Education
* German label:  Leibniz-Institut für Bildungsforschung und Bildungsinformation

Anyway, the translation of ""Veterinäruntersuchungsamt"" as ""Veterinary Investigations Office""  seems closer to accurate than ""Veterinary Testing Agency"" so this request makes sense to me. They don't use an English version of their name on their website as far as I can see, so we could also just go with the official German name as the primary label.

Anyway, for now I think just doing as requested here makes the most sense. So change is:

However, most of their  website is in English  and they do use an English name there  for the  institute - ""Institute for Research and Innovation in Health"".

So I  recommend:
* Primary name: i3S -  Institute for Research and Innovation in Health, University of Porto

comment_text: A couple of other publications with this affiliation besides the one they provided:
https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-1809.2010.00607.x
https://doi.org/10.3390/genes8100270
and I found at least 3 different researchers using the affiliation. So I think this qualifies for a ROR id. Their website redirects to another site though and doesn't have much info. Maybe another person should check this out and see if they can find anything else about the company. But I think it should be in ROR.

The other ID mentioned - https://isni.org/isni/0000000494574274 -has the new name so I think it should be preferred. So the change should be:
*  Remove ISNI  http://isni.org/isni/0000000119314040
* Add https://isni.org/isni/0000000494574274 as preferred ISNI id

comment_text: Clearly a significant research organization. However, as the ""About page"" notes, ""Since 2009, the IRB is affiliated with the Università della Svizzera italiana (USI)"" and the website domain is now under the university's domain, and the university logo is displayed on the site (but there's not much other mention of it). ROR id for the university is https://ror.org/03c4atk17. I notice that on the referenced publication, all the researchers with this affiliation include both this institute and the university as part of their affiliation statement. Is it really separate? I guess it was from 2000-2009 so maybe that's enough justification. Possibly arguable as to whether this really qualifies as ""top level"" now, but nonetheless I think it should have its own ROR id.

comment_text: Scholarly research is conducted at the institute and published using the institute as an affiliation (jointly with the  the Università della Svizzera italiana (USI), as noted by first curator). Copyright to the website is owned by institute, not USI. The institute has multiple research groups and facilities, and the ""People"" page seems to indicates that it is somewhat autonomous from USI, having it's own support and administrative staff. Add to ROR with USI as parent organization.

comment_text: Recommended change seems fine. The www-prefixed website we have now redirects to the one without the www so let's follow that as well. So we should move the current Dutch (NL) label to the primary label, move the current primary label to an alternate, and shorten the website URL as requested.
I can't confirm the Ringgold ID except that Wikidata also has 1190 so that seems fine too (if we include these at all).

comment_text: I added a wikipedia link and the Wikidata and ISNI ids. Note that (from the Sovenian wikipedia page) this research institute contains 17 sub-units including an apparently prominent ""Institute of Philosophy"" which is included as one of the names ISNI lists for this institute.

comment_text: This organization supports and conducts oceans research, and hosts a repository for oceans data. It is not already in ROR, and it is used as an affiliation (see links in submission).

It is also a top-level organization. SLGO is part of the [Canadian Integrated Oceans Observing System (CIOOS)](https://cioos.ca/), along with CIOOS Atlantic and CIOOS Pacific: https://ogsl.ca/en/cioos/. However, SLGO is an independent organization from CIOOS and predates CIOOS. I checked with a colleague and we are not sure if [CIOOS Atlantic](https://cioosatlantic.ca/) and [CIOOS Pacific](https://cioospacific.ca/) are equally independent, but SLGO definitely is.

In addition to adding SLGO, I would also recommend adding CIOOS (the national organization) to ROR. We may still indicate a ""parent"" relationship here, in that SLGO is one of the three partner ""regional associations"" that together form the national CIOOS. See the governance structure here - https://www.cioos.ca/governance/.

A few metadata notes:

- For the related organizations submitted, I am not sure if it makes sense to list all of these members here. There are many more members listed on this page: https://ogsl.ca/en/members-list/. This seems like it would be difficult to maintain. 
- For the labels: I would not capitalize ""global"" in ""Observatoire global du Saint-Laurent"".

I recommend adding SLGO to ROR.

comment_text: I agree with Kelly here - SLGO/OGSL is an independent research organization that should be in ROR. I did not find any Wikidata/Wikipedia or ISNI entries for it; however several people (data scientists) list it as their employer in LinkedIn.  I also agree that it would make sense to add an entry for CIOOS.

comment_text: This organization provides data used in research; they also publish their own bulletins, and I did find some papers on Google Scholar using this affiliation (though they may have been self-published by the organization?). It has been around for several decades in any case. While  it is a wholly-owned agency of the government of the Canary Islands it does appear sufficiently independent and is credited directly in these publications, so I think it does count as ""top-level"" for our purposes and should have its own ROR id.

comment_text: I added wikipedia and wikidata links; also ISNI, however I think the ISNI refers to a previous institute with a very similar name that was merged into this one? So maybe that shouldn't be used. Though we don't have a ROR for the previous institute and there doesn't seem to be an ISNI with this newer name.

Anyway, definitely a research-involved organization with a long history etc. and used as an affiliation - for example this person lists it in their publications: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-9376-7344

So it should have a ROR ID!

comment_text: I agree this meets criteria for inclusion in ROR. For the name, looking at similar organizations' entries, ROR sometimes includes the phrase ""State Institution"" at the front, e.g.: https://ror.org/04zjdjw13. We may want to include this either as the primary name, or in an alias, for consistency.

For related organizations: the parent institution is the Ministry of Education and Science (per http://www.uintei.kiev.ua/en/page/about-ukristei), which has a ROR ID: https://ror.org/03bra4w96. Relatedly, I think the Ministry of Education and Science record should also be updated to have the country name in the primary name field, otherwise it is hard to find.

comment_text: While this meets some of our criteria, I believe it does not qualify for a ROR at this time for the following reasons:
1. It is a research project within the University of Göttingen, and when used as an affiliation the university is always included as part of the affiliation from the cases I've looked at; in fact authors usually directly reference the university (perhaps with a department), and not this project, as their affiliation. They do seem to acknowledge this project as a funding source.
2. I don't believe these are intended to be long-term organizations; this one has existed only since 2019. More information on the German ""Clusters of Excellence"" (there are 57 right now) here: https://www.research-in-germany.org/en/research-landscape/excellence-universities/clusters-of-excellence.html

*However* we do have at least 2 of the Clusters of Excellence in ROR right now, so on the grounds that we have included these before it could be argued this one qualifies also:
https://ror.org/05tbc9841 - Cluster of Excellence ""Matters of Activity. Image Space Material"" at Humboldt University Berlin
https://ror.org/034waa237 - Cluster of Excellence on Plant Sciences at University of Dusseldorf.

comment_text: I agree with Arthur and this topic should also be discussed within the ROR curation team.

Here are some more details on Clusters of Excellence
- they have a duration of seven years (with possibility of renewal) and are associated with a host institution
- information from the DFG ""Clusters of excellence enable German university locations to establish internationally visible, competitive research and training facilities, thereby enhancing scientific networking and cooperation among the participating institutions. Clusters of excellence should form an important part of a university's strategic and thematic planning, significantly raise its profile and reflect its considered long-term priorities."" https://www.dfg.de/en/research_funding/programmes/excellence_initiative/clusters_excellence/index.html

there are already some more Clusters of Excellence in ROR, which would make a case for including ""Multiscale Bioimaging"" :
- https://ror.org/05874db82 - Excellence Cluster Universe -> replaced by ORIGINS (https://ror.org/010wkny21)
- https://ror.org/04c4bwh63 - Cologne Excellence Cluster on Cellular Stress Responses in Aging Associated Diseases

comment_text: I added some additional metadata to the request. There is an extensive publication list available from the link they provide, hundreds of papers (looked like mostly conference proceedings?) per year. While it is not exactly a top-level organization given its relationship with the NAES there, we create records for institutions that are similar units of other national academies, so I think this should have its own ROR also.

comment_text: This seems straightforward. However, we perhaps want to make the main name the English one they provide, ""Kartal Kosuyolu High Specialization Training and Research Hospital"", and keep their suggested name along with some of the alternatives as language labels (Turkish).

The old website URL does not appear to be responding, so we definitely should update that as well.

comment_text: Yes, the website needs to be changed - I recommend just listing the main site https://www.htw-berlin.de/ (but if we can add the English one also that's fine too).
And yes the German version of the name needs Berlin added, otherwise it has the same name as many other such institutions in Germany!

comment_text: I agree we should make this change as indicated. The ROR metadata policies states that ""The primary name field defaults to English when an English version of an organization’s name is available."" In this case, an English version of the name is not available since the organization's guidelines specify that it should not be translated.

Would we move the English translated name to the alias field, or remove it entirely?

Nevertheless this appears to be a significant well-established museum that is widely referred to in research publications, though I couldn't find a lot of cases where it was actually an affiliation (there were a few though). I've added ISNI and  Wikipedia ID's. I think this should have a ROR id.

comment_text: Does not appear to be used as an affiliation, but it is referenced in a number of research articles (via Google Scholar). They mention relevance as a funder but they don't seem to have a Crossref Funder entry. We do have a number of other national sports-related ministries in ROR though, so maybe this should have an ID; I guess given all of the above I'd lean toward yes it should have an ID.

However, considering this organization would like a ROR ID to be acknowledged as a research funder and similar government organizations exist in ROR we can assign a ROR ID.

comment_text: This appears to be an organization that hosts conferences and has, for the last seven years, published a journal, SYNCROINFO (http://media-publisher.eu/synchroinfo-journal/) focused on synchronization, signal shaping and processing. It is not already in ROR. 

-is associated with research publications and/or other activities, as evidenced as its use as an affiliation on the following works:

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9619169
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9619185
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9619176

Potential issues include that the journal's start date precedes the org's start date by four years (2015 vs. 2019) and a seemingly small number of persons affiliated.

The related organization ""Media Publisher LLC"" seems to be based in Russia - see https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q110586198 for example - I assume that was where the journal started, before IRIS was organized. Maybe the organizers moved from Moscow to Vienna in or before 2019?

All that might put me in favor of waiting on this one, but they are publishing in IEEE journals, so in the end I think we should proceed with adding this to ROR now.

Hmm, I guess it is in a different location within Spain, but they both seem to go by ""Artificial Intelligence Research Institute"" or some version of that. The other one is clearly part of CSIC and this one makes no mention. Also associated with different universities (Barcelona vs Valladolid).

comment_text: This is clearly a research-involved organization, but as a funder and supplier of facilities/resources, I don't see it used as an affiliation in itself. So another of those cases... Also they have no Crossref Funder ID, neither under their current or previous (Australian Phenomics Network - APN) names. I also don't see ROR or Crossref Funder ID's for their parent - National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS). Anyway, unless we can find people who actually use this as an affiliation, I think  it's another to be added to further discussion if this is the sort of thing we should be including or not.

comment_text: Clearly a research-involved organization, it seems to be mostly a funder, but not in Crossref Funder Registry. I could not find it used as an affiliation in the linked publications - nor acknowledged either with full name or as PHRN. I did find it in ISNI (added to metadata above). Again it is part of NCRIS in Australia, for which we don't have a ROR id either. If we add ""Phenomics Australia"" then we should add this one, but again this is another that I think needs further discussion.

comment_text: To confirm this capitalization request is how it is displayed by the organization itself, see this page: http://www.ipgp.jussieu.fr/en/governance
But for example in affiliations the other words do seem to typically be capitalized - for example the affiliations in this article: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2012GL052387
Anyway, as the organization has requested the capitalization change I think we should accept it.

On the English name, I can't find ""Paris Institute of Earth Physics"" or the lower-case version they request anywhere on their website. Wikidata does use ""Paris Institute of Earth Physics"" as the English label though. This does seem a better translation of the name than the current one we have, so since they requested it I'm fine with making that change.

As to the website - both our current url and the one they request work and provide exactly the same set of web pages, and both on their contact page suggest 'ipgp.fr' is the correct domain now, so I agree we should switch to the shorter URL for the website.

So, recommended changes are:
* primary label should be ""Institut de physique du globe de Paris""
* English label should be ""Paris Institute of Earth Physics""
* Website should be https://www.ipgp.fr

comment_text: The English web page of the university - https://www.unibw.de/home-en - uses the German name - ""Universität der Bundeswehr München"" everywhere. Although they also have an acronym version they use too: ""UniBw M"" which it would probably be good for ROR to add. So maybe we should just drop this English label altogether? It's not clear from the request that the university was actually asking us to use their ""translation"" rather than just telling us a translation??

As to dropping the English entirely, I would err on the side of including an English version. @MSpenger do you have any insights as to which English version of the name should be used ( ""University of the Bundeswehr Munich"" or ""University of the Federal Armed Forces Munich"") or whether it would be best to omit an English version altogether?

Clearly a well-established and independent institute. I found a large number of references to it on Google scholar, including naming people who are or were professors there, but it seemed difficult to find use as an affiliation in scholarly literature.

comment_text: So the question to me here is whether we should make this ROR the id for the top-level organization (which seems relatively new) - ""Phoenix Hospital Group"". This top-level org has Phoenix Hospital Chelmsford as a subsidiary, but also Weymouth Street Hospital and a couple of additional clinics (based on their website). We don't have a ROR for any of these right now, only this one for the Chelmsford location.

The website we currently have redirects to the main ""phoenixhospitalgroup.com"" page now. There is also a new Wikidata ID for the Chelmsford hospital: Q88222461, and Q88222468 for ""Phoenix Hospital Group"", also Q20714162 for Weymouth Street Hospital.

If we keep this as just the id for the Chelmsford hospital then I think we should also keep the name ""Baddow Hospital"" as an alias for historical purposes as we do in other cases where a name has changed. We can add ""Phoenix Hospital Group"" also as an alias and adjust the website as requested, assuming we don't create a new id for ""Phoenix Hospital Group"" separately. Not sure on this - I guess the minimal change is to go ahead as requested without creating new id's or changing to top level rght now.

comment_text: I agree we should keep this record specific to the Chelmsford location. However, if we do that, I'm not sure about adding ""Phoenix Hospital Group"" as an alias when it's really the parent org. I would propose creating a new ROR ID for the parent instead.

Side question on our process - do we update Wikidata when we update/add new ROR IDs? I noticed that the Baddow Hospital Wikidata page (Q30292854) references this ROR ID, but it isn't on the Chelmsford hospital Wikidata page (Q88222461) - we could add it there too.

Moving to ""Needs discussion"".

I'm a little wary of creating new records for corporate parent entities like hospital groups without documented use cases for ROR IDs. I'll add this as a discussion topic for a future meeting.

comment_text: This appears to be new; it is one of 84 CSIRO ""labs and facilities"" listed here: https://www.csiro.au/en/work-with-us/use-our-labs-facilities

I don't think we want to add all 84 to ROR. I spot-checked a handful of them and could find none currently in ROR, though we may have some of them. I think this one is technically a subsidiary of ""CSIRO Land & Water"" - https://ror.org/057xz1h85 - but I don't know if that would be included in any affiliation for a researcher at this facility. Anyway, given they have no publications as yet I recommend we either put this on hold until there's more research output associated with it, or probably better to just say no as it is not a top-level research org which ROR is focused on right now.

comment_text: Hi folks, I would appreciate a reconsideration of this submission please.
The use case is the acknowledgement of the use of a facility. Facilities in CSIRO are ""managed"" by a specific business unit, but may be used by anyone in the organisation, or researchers external to CSIRO. This use case is not about affiliation of the authors.
We note the inclusion of a ROR in the Acknowledgements section of this journal article, https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stab1823, to acknowledge the use of National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center; this is a use case for facilities, ""research resources"" in ORCID's language, with the potential to push metadata of successful proposals to a researcher's ORCID record, and to support the tracking of publications that acknowledge the use of such facilities.

comment_text: Hello! I'm not on the review team but the Australian Research Data Commons is watching this thread with great interest. I'm not sure if Australia has a strange model, but we have quite a few ""national facilities"" that are administered as sub-units or sub-sub-units of other organisations. These national facilities are often funded at a national and/or state level, but are administered through existing organisations.

Despite the way they are administered, they have their own identity and can be used by any researcher. Reiterating @alslib's point, the particular use case here is around tracking the acknowledgements/citations of those facilities and all of the instruments/services belonging to that facility.

An example is the John de Laeter Centre (JdLC) here Perth, Western Australia. The JdLC reports through Curtin University's Faculty of Science and Engineering, but the JdLC itself is a national-scale facility that attracts state and national funding to house instruments and provide services to all researchers, not just those at Curtin University. It does some of its own original research, but most research undertaken using its instruments is undertaken by researchers _not_ based there. I know for a fact that the Director of the JdLC is always looking for up-to-date evidence of usage.

Strasburg as affiliation). However, it is also a CNRS -funded institute.

comment_text: We may need to have a consistent approach to CNRS funded institutes, including UMRs. My understanding is that they not independent of universities, but they can be cross-institutional collaborations. They can also be time-limited since funding is renewable, not ongoing. Looking at the Advanced Search at https://annuaire.cnrs.fr/NavigationServlet there are over 1,400 with Country=France.

Does anyone on the curation advisory board have more context for how these are structured? I found https://www.cnrs.fr/fr/cnrsinfo/le-cnrs-simplifie-ses-structures-de-recherche but I am still fuzzy on the details.

comment_text: I agree with Kelly on taking a bigger-picture look in the future at all of the CNRS-related records. 

For the present case, it looks like the institute formed recently as a merger between the Institute of Earth Physics of Strasbourg and the Laboratory of Hydrology and Geochemistry of Strasbourg (see https://ites.unistra.fr/linstitut/historique-anciennes-umrs). The second entity has a ROR ID: https://ror.org/03y81da23. 

Given the number of publications already associated with the institute, and its unique position with having multiple parents (Univ of Strasbourg, CNRS, and ENGEES), and its position as a merged entity of the prior two organizations, I think it would make sense to create a new ROR ID for Institut Terre et Environnement de Strasbourg. 

I will file a separate issue for redirecting https://ror.org/03y81da23 to the new ROR ID when we have redirecting functionality in place, and another issue for analyzing and cleaning up CNRS records.

comment_text: This has been addressed via #207. However, the original ID for ECI Telecom https://ror.org/01jdgyj97 no longer resolves because ROR does not yet support redirect functionality. We will plan to enable a redirect in future. 

When we do wholesale work across the registry to handle records that were made inactive by GRID, we can address the question of how to represent historical relationships and historical names in the metadata. 

For now this issue can be closed.

Edited primary name from ""Institute for Social and Political Psychology"" to ""Institute of Social and Political Psychology"" to match the name listed in English version of the organization's website (using website's language dropdown option). @adambuttrick - Less clear on how to handle the label. I think it should be changed to ""Інститут соціальної та політичної психології"" with the ""НАПН України"" removed as that portion translates to ""of the National Academy of Educational Sciences of Ukraine"".

Provides datasets and produces reports on the related to the resources under their charge (e.g., https://doi.org/10.48799). I can't find them yet on Datacite, so I believe the request for a ROR ID may be part of their move to the platform.

Not certain whether to use the form provided for the primary name. Mailing address on their site simply list ""L’eau des collines."" I believe SPL is an abbreviation for ""Société publique locale du pays d'Aubagne et de l'Etoile.""

comment_text: Ok, it's about 10 years old, and it does seem to be somewhat involved in research. Given that we've added a few similar organizations previously I think this is fine. While SPL is a type-of-organization abbreviation it appears to be a relatively limited and new one (the website mentions it's from a law dated May 2010) so I think it's ok in this case to leave it as part of the name as they requested.

comment_text: I added wikipedia/wikidata/ISNI id's.

This appears to be a relatively new museum in the Netherlands, and has gone  through several names - the English wikipedia page mentions ""Jannink Museum of Textiles and Social Life""  and ""TwentseWelle"" as previous names. From their website they appear to be closely related to (share governance with) ""Rijksmuseum Twenthe"", a much more well-established museum in the same city, which also does not seem to be in ROR.

""Rijksmuseum Twenthe"" seems to be well-referenced in research literature, though not as an affiliation.  I couldn't find any references to ""De MuseumFabriek"", or  ""The MuseumFactory"", perhaps because those  names are relatively new. I  did find  some ""TwentseWelle"" references (but again not as affiliations).

This seems to be a borderline case to me. Perhaps we should put it on hold for now, given the newness of the name. If we do add a ROR id for this we should definitely also add one for ""Rijksmuseum Twenthe"", with which it is related.

Presumably it hasn't happened there yet because the change was made only in the German language Wikipedia, and they just moved the article to a new name rather than creating a new one.

Have you come to any conclusions on what to do about redirects etc. on the ROR side for a case like this?

comment_text: KAGRA appears to be associated with the Gravitational Wave Group at the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research, which is based at the University of Tokyo. There is a list of related publications here: https://www.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/gr/GWPOHPe/reports-e.html. 

The ICRR is based at the University of Tokyo, but it is referred to as an ""inter-university research institute"" (https://www.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/about-icrr-2/directors-greetings/). I think it's sufficiently independent that we could add the ICRR to ROR, but I'm not sure if KAGRA is in scope. Do we have other examples of facilities like this in ROR?

If we do add KAGRA, we might want to add some of the other ICRR facilities listed here: https://www.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/facility/.

comment_text: Ah, good to point that out. The KAGRA website is under ICRR's domain, but as it notes: ""KAGRA is hosted by the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research (ICRR), the University of Tokyo, and co-hosted by the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) and National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ)"" so it's not purely part of University of Tokyo.
Among the ""ICRR facilities"", I believe CTA does have a ROR id already (and is also not just a U Tokyo facility): https://ror.org/020jy7109
Kamioka Observatory I think also deserves one, it's a major physics research facility that's been operating for decades. Not sure about the others.
That said, ICRR is a pretty major institute in its own right and maybe should have a ROR even though it is indeed part of U Tokyo. It does seem to have its own Crossref Funder ID: https://doi.org/10.13039/501100013260

Judging by this, I believe ICRR is in scope, as well as the Kamioka Observatory. KAGRA is a little more nebulous, as it is related to Kamioka Observatory, but also conducts independent research using its own equipment and hosts conferences. On the ICRR site, Kamioka and KAGRA are also listed as separate facilities: https://www.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/facility/

There appear to be only a small number of researchers involved, but it is more than one. It's not clear to me they're conducting much scholarly research here. I'm not sure on this one. Maybe it should wait a bit to be more well-established?

ROR submitted it to GRID for inclusion but it was not approved by GRID at the time. I am reinstating the request now so that we can create the entry in ROR.

comment_text: @mariagould is it acceptable/preferable for users to create issues directly rather than go via the web form? 
I saw the ""new issue"" button and that there were two templates and assumed it was ok. Speaking personally, creating it here is easier than the form, and I know I will then be following updates automatically rather than having to come into Git after doing the webform, find the issue, and then follow it. ps I should also say that the issue auto-assigned to you when it was created

comment_text: @icraig-afk Adam Buttrick, here. I'm ROR's new Metadata Curation Lead. Yes, you may submit record requests using the new and update issue templates. It's not currently our preferred method for all requests, as we have issues with data completeness in requests that the form helps mitigate. But for those that are active within ROR community and know our ins and outs better than most, submitting via Github is fine as well. Please let me know if you have any questions about using the issue templates themselves.

In 2014, the Horlivka Institute for Foreign Languages was moved by the Ukrainian government to Bakhmut.

comment_text: Identified as a parent/related org in #442. ""Network of networks"" for global LTERs. Manages the Dynamic Ecological Information Management System – Site and Dataset Registry (https://deims.org/), to which LTER around site contribute ecological monitoring data. Since https://ror.org/039kwqk96 is in scope, ILTER is as well.

comment_text: This should not be processed as a split, but a request to add four new children for Italy's National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development. Assuming approval, I'll create separate record requests for each of these.

As to their scope, these do appear to be independent, national-level research facilities with their own specific focuses. Each has its own publication affiliation usage as well:

ENEA Casaccia Research Centre
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085367280

ENEA Frascati Research Centre
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37314209000

ENEA Brasimone
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086187013

ENEA Italian Natiional Institute of Ionizing Radiation Metrology
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37529688700

Use case is similar to #49 and #386, tracking research outputs. I think these should be added to ROR.

comment_text: I've found the Italian research institute organizations generally quite confusing - for CNR or INFN they seem to have multiple differing hierarchical breakdowns, with the bottom level being what seem to be quite small university-level institutes of (sometimes) just a handful of people. But I agree with the main point of Adam's comment above that we should keep https://ror.org/02an8es95 as the main organization with headquarters in Rome, and add subsidiary orgs as needed. Note the wikipedia page for ENEA lists 11 research centers in addition to the Rome headquarters, so more than just these 4 requested, and that list does not seem to include the ""Italian National Institute of Ionizing Radiation Metrology"" so as usual, confusing.

By the way, what is https://ror.org/01sfh2b07 ?  A branch of this Italian agency in London? Or a mistake?

ENEA Frascati has a Wikidata entry: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q40211354
and ISNI: https://isni.org/isni/0000000406480033
Also the Brasimone (Bologna) center I think: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q54856965
although the latter doesn't seem to mention Brasimone at all so not sure?

Anyway, in general consider this ""approved"" - I'll move it to the ""ready for signoff"" column but what we really want is a number of new requests to add these specific research centers.

comment_text: I'm also not sure but I think the point is there are lots of hospitals in the Netherlands that don't have ROR id's yet? But I don't think we want to create ID's for every hospital - we certainly haven't done that for every hospital in the US or other countries!

The Wikidata query at least as transcribed here is a bit garbled; I edited and trimmed it down to the following:
https://w.wiki/4Kyd
which lists the hospital networks in the Netherlands, how many individual hospital (buildings?) they have, and the ROR id if they have one. It's 69 hospital groups, of which 16 (mostly the larger ones) currently have ROR id's. I don't think it's justified to add ROR id's for the remaining 53; we could look through them one by one to see if they are used as affiliations or otherwise  appear in research publications, but that seems a bit too much for our resources right now. Also the request was nominally to ""split an existing ROR record"" but I don't see that in this query or request at all, so  I have to say I'm a little confused as to what is actually being asked for.

comment_text: Ah, but it turns out a lot of the individual hospitals have ROR id's themselves (at least as recorded in  WIkidata):
https://w.wiki/4Kyg
-- that is, of the 69 hospital groups, 47 have at least one hospital with a ROR id. That includes 5 groups that have their own ROR id's. It seems a bit of a mess, I'll see if I can make better sense of it all and try to propose a way forward here.

comment_text: I created a google doc with the full list from Wikidata  here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GPjrMuojAUwzKKh4-03MHWFYXdjGDLXbHbUcogo9Hbs/edit?usp=sharing

The following hospital group/networks don't have any ROR id's themselves, nor any subsidiary hospitals with ROR's (at least as counted here):
* Ommelander Ziekenhuis Groningen (Q1943201)
* Pantein (Q1978017)
* ZorgSaam Ziekenhuis (Q3034260)
* St Jansdal Ziekenhuis (Q59384173)
* Saxenburgh Groep (Q97380654)
* Antonius Zorggroep (Q97382945)
* Rivas Zorggroep (Q97383459)
* BovenIJ Ziekenhuis (Q97456244)
* St. Jans Gasthuis (Q97482069)
* Spijkenisse Medisch Centrum (Q97500811)
* Wilhelmina Ziekenhuis Assen (Q97537594)

I would suggest these do not need ROR id's at this time, though we could run them through our usual check for use as affiliations if we thought it justified?

The  following hospital groups have no ROR id, but do have either multiple subsidiaries with a ROR id, or one with a ROR id and a considerably different name, so I think we should create a new ROR id for these ""top-level"" research-involved hospital organizations: 
* OLVG (Q21152541)
* Dijklander Ziekenhuis (Q62022997)
* Zorgpartners Friesland (Q97377399)
* Stichting Reinier Haga Groep (Q97383180)
* Santiz (Q97387477)
* Erasmus Medisch Centrum (Q97482050)
* Leids Universitair Medisch Centrum (Q97485881)
* Universitair Medisch Centrum Groningen (Q97534083)
* Universitair Medisch Centrum St. Radboud (Q97534111)
* Universitair Medisch Centrum Utrecht (Q97534164)

For the following (also with no ROR id) there's just one lower level organization that has a ROR id, and the name is substantially the same as the network, so I think the best solution is to move the ROR id to the top level (within Wikidata) and make any adjustments to name/location or other metadata within  ROR that may be needed to be clear about what the ROR identifies:
* Admiraal de Ruyterziekenhuis (Q36423003) - ROR 04r0k8112
* Albert Schweitzer Ziekenhuis (Q97383147) -  ROR 00e8ykd54

comment_text: For the new ID's, I inserted the bulk request form into the Google sheet I created (linked above); the ""New ID's"" tab has the list of records we should probably add to ROR. One of them I decided should not be added however - ""Santiz"" was dissolved at the beginning of  2021 so should not be needed any longer.

I reached out to the requester about supplying information for the handful that are missing.

 Facilitates exchange and coordination between these research centers, aggregates and publishes their research outputs, and represents them internationally. Believe this is in scope for ROR.

comment_text: Ok, I've reviewed these and added my assessments.
One of the 4 remaining ones is also already in ROR - https://ror.org/01vmqaq17 has changed its name to NORSUS.
Of the other 3, two had clear uses as affiliations and do seem actively engaged in research. The last is the new one and doesn't seem to have been used as an affiliation itself yet - I'm not sure why as it's not so very new but even very recent (2022) publications by the listed author seem to use a different affiliation, and google scholar found nothing. Nevertheless I suppose for completeness it would be useful to add this one also.

comment_text: I removed the Wikidata ID from the metadata fields as the item has been deleted there (no external references).

It's only a bit over a year old and they've published only a few items so far. Also there seem to be 3 related organizations here (mentioned on the ""related organizations"" line):
Oku Okut Yayınları - the publishing arm
Oku Okut Akademi - an educational arm I guess

I think this is marginal - is this really related to research as we understand it? For example here's one of their books: https://www.ceeol.com/search/book-detail?id=1031808

As always these marginal ones take the most time to figure out. I guess we can be generous here and let it have an identifier, at least that will give some way of linking together what they do.

comment_text: Geoscience research institute in Albania. Publishes monthly seismological and climate-related datasets (https://www.geo.edu.al/newweb/?fq=sizmobuletinet&gj=gj2&kid=36 ; . While technically operating under the Polytechnic University of Tirana, is used as an independent affiliation in peer-reviewed journals (e.g. https://www.geo.edu.al/skedaret/Handy_etal_19_Tectonics.pdf) and as a leading affiliation (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kujtim-Onuzi). Believe this should be added to ROR.

comment_text: I know these Kavli institutes are often closely associated with universities (in this case NTNU) but I'm beginning to think we should treat them each as independent entities anyway by virtue of the Kavli association. Kavli lists 20 institutes right now - https://kavlifoundation.org/institutes - of which this is one, and I believe we have 4 of the others in ROR already. I think it would make sense to add all of them, as we have done for Max Planck institutes for example. Anyway, I agree there's a good case for this one at least.

comment_text: The website in the metadata section goes to the old Canadian Polar Commission site. I assume we should use the new site but not sure what it should be (https://www.canada.ca/en/polar-knowledge.html ??)

Otherwise yes this makes sense to create as a new record, deprecating the old entry.

I could go either way on this request, maybe leading towards denying because of how closely tied the are to the university, so would appreciate additional feedback.

comment_text: It has its own website, and seems to be listed on its own (without mention of William & Mary) in most affiliation usage. On the other hand the relation with W&M seems a bit confusing. From this page: https://www.vims.edu/about/leadership_admin/vims_boards/index.php it looks like they report to two separate boards, one of which is the one responsible for the college, but which also states ""VIMS is a state agency, established in the Code of Virginia, and an institution of higher education with a tripartite mission of research, education, and advisory services."" It may not be exactly 'top level', but it seems close enough for me. I'm moving this to needs discussion since I'm not quite sure what Adam's position is, but if he's ok with creating a ROR for this then let's do that. Thanks.

comment_text: Their ""other publications"" seem to mostly predate the formation of the institute! However at least one publication there lists this as the affiliation, and clearly they have plans for growth. Since we have (most of?) the other Max Weber Foundation institutes in ROR, we should add this one too.

comment_text: German institute operated out of Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin that is responsible for monitoring whether Germany’s schools meet academic targets set by the country's federal government. Publication affiliation usage is primarily as a leading affiliation for Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, but I believe separate state support and work as a quasi-government entity is enough to establish independence from the university. Should be added to ROR.

Other information about this request:


Briefly explain why you are requesting a ROR ID for this organization and how the ROR ID will be used. | The Continental Scientific Drilling Facility is a national facility funded by NSF for support of scientific research involving drilling and coring on land and in lakes, core analysis, and curation. The ROR ID will allow unique linkages between the facility and the researchers it supports, and the outputs from this research.

Provide DOI(s) or links for research associated with this organization, such as published articles that include the organization's name as an affiliation. If DOIs or links are not available, describe the research-related activities of this organization. | https://experts.umn.edu/en/organisations/continental-scientific-drilling-facility

Other relevant metadata about the organization (e.g., name variants in other languages, related records in ROR, links to external records such as Wikidata) | Name variants include CSD Facility, CSDF, and the former facilities that merged to form the current facility in mid-2020: LacCore and CSDCO (Continental Scientific Drilling Coordination Office). Earlier variants include the Limnological Research Center or LRC, which sometimes still appear in publications.

Please add any other information about this request if needed | We are rebuilding our website and will soon have a new URL, which we will update with ROR when the website launches.

comment_text: Determination: The **Continental Scientific Drilling Coordination Office (CSDCO)** is an NSF research facility sufficiently independent from parent organization (University of Minnesota) and has affiliation use (see https://sd.copernicus.org/articles/26/1/2019/).

comment_text: The request indicates this is a new organization - ""Continental Scientific Drilling Facility"", which combines the older LacCore and CSDCO. I cannot find any reference to this new organization other than the link they provide for publications: https://experts.umn.edu/en/organisations/continental-scientific-drilling-facility and an NSF grant award from May last year: https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1951112

As @nlundvick noted there are affiliations using the older entities (although they also seem to always be at University of Minnesota). The CSDCO website which is the main link provided does not mention the new name. Perhaps we should wait for their new website? Otherwise I do think this is generally suitable.

Which part of the record needs to be changed? Primary name
Description of change: We would like to inform you that by the order of the Ministry of Health of Ukraine of February 10, 2021 № 225 ""On changing the type, renaming and approval of the Charter of the National University of Health of Ukraine named after PL Shupyk (new edition)"" National Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education named after PL Shupyk was renamed the PL Shupyk National University of Health of Ukraine (abbreviated name: PL Shupyk National Health Insurance Institute of Ukraine). PL Shupyk National University of Health of Ukraine is the legal successor of all rights and responsibilities of the PL Shupyk National Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education. Relevant documents can be found on the official website of the university: www.nuozu.edu.ua; e-mail address: office@nuozu.edu.ua

comment_text: The old website (which we currently list) redirects to the new one:
https://nuozu.edu.ua/
The name listed on the English version of the new website is:
""Shupyk National Healthcare University of Ukraine""

The name in Ukrainian from the website is:
""Національний університет охорони здоров'я України імені П. Л. Шупика""

so I think we should change the primary name and the Ukrainian label as above, and also the website link.

Then add as alias the name they ask for ""PL Shupyk National University of Health of Ukraine"" (this doesn't appear on the website - I think they must have Google translated the Ukrainian name?)

However, I'm also confused because the Ministry of Health website still refers to it by the old name: https://en.moz.gov.ua/educational-institutions. 

Let's check back on this later to confirm.

comment_text: I added the ISNI id.
I'm not sure about this one. Searching Goolge scholar I found only a handful of publications from this institute, with 3 different authors, only two of whom actually used the institute as an affiliation; both published only in ""IRJMS"" (https://www.irjms.com) which is a very new journal and seems a little sketchy. The website for the institute seems to be mostly talking about the founder, with great plans for the future and some recent donations etc. but not much that I can see of current status (I don't see any lists of actual researchers anywhere?) I guess it's still a new organization. I'd be inclined to hold this one for later? Willing to defer to a second opinion on this though.

comment_text: Website change is fine, but the name here is somewhat confusing. Branding takes the form ""IMT Mines Albi-Carmaux - Ecole Mines-Télécom,"" but their [legal statement](https://www.imt-mines-albi.fr/en/node/1519) still uses the form ""École Nationale Supérieure des Mines d'Albi-Carmaux."" Can't find this hybrid form anywhere.

comment_text: As far as I can tell, it looks like the shorter version ""IMT Mines Albi"" tends to be used in affiliations (e.g., https://doi.org/10.1002/pen.25901, https://doi.org/10.1080/00218464.2021.2024808). I would suggest adding the longer-form name ""École Nationale Supérieure des Mines d'Albi-Carmaux"" as an alias. I think we can probably drop the alias ""Les Mines Albi"".

URL update looks fine.

comment_text: I think this proposed change may be fine, although what the ROR record (inherited from GRID) was intended to capture is a little murky. It has aliases and acronyms for the entity ""NMi-Van Swinden Laboratorium,"" but according to Wikipedia, these two were split apart in 2009. NMi still exists as a separate organization (https://nmi.nl/) and is also in ROR (https://ror.org/053xpwt63). This may have been an error on GRID's part or simply was never updated. I think there probably should have been a deprecation and split, but if others agree this is the record for the split VSL entity, consistent with NMi's separate representation in ROR, I will update accordingly.

comment_text: I think it makes sense to treat this one as the primary VSL entry. The one suggestion I would make would be to the aliases. I would move ""Van Swinden Laboratorium"" to aliases, and I would also include other versions of the English name that appear to be in use (""National Metrology Institute of the Netherlands,"" ""Netherlands Metrology Institute"")

comment_text: Chinese organization responsible for metrology and related services. Solid affiliation usage. Similar to https://ror.org/02m5haa59 and https://ror.org/035gbps25.

The correct link for this organization is http://www.birm-weather.com/, per Wikidata and the LinkedIn page, but from the Wayback Machine archive, it appears to have been offline for a few years (last indexing is from 2019). I'm seeing affiliation usage from 2022 (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9721065), so they are likely still active. Not certain if we should just drop the link entirely, include dead, or something else.

They also appear to be a sub-entity of a state-owned corporation, which makes them more a company than a Goverment organization, although admittedly, this is a bit nebulous. Parent, which is also a state-owned corporation, is listed as a company. Perhaps this is a case for having more than one type?

This is a web archiving project that coordinates with six major libraries in the UK. It does not appear to be used as an affiliation in published research. However, I would propose that we consider it for inclusion as a repository. It is similar to other web archiving projects already represented in ROR, such as the Internet Archive.

> It is a project with the ENVRI-FAIR consortium (https://envri.eu/home-envri-fair/) that has increased the urgency for the ROR ID. The GFF has been commissioned, along with the Environmental Agency Austria to upgrade a tool call FAIR Implementation Profile Wizard, which helps communities to create machine-readable FAIR Implementation Profiles. The ENVRI-FAIR consortium, in close collaboration with GO FAIR, have been leading the development of the FAIR Implementation Profile method, and the FIP Wizard tool. [...] A key function, namely the GFF “qualification” or endorsement of FAIR Enabling Resources, will require a globally unique and persistent identifier for the GO FAIR Foundation. Hence, our request. 

The foundation does appear as an affiliation in extant publications (e.g., https://doi.org/10.1162/dint_a_00050).

The foundation is related the GO FAIR initiative (https://www.go-fair.org/) as well as to the GO FAIR International Support and Coordination Office (GFISCO) (https://www.go-fair.org/go-fair-initiative/go-fair-offices/). 

I think it is in scope for ROR to represent GO FAIR as an organization that is involved in certifying and producing research, but I think we need to review whether the ROR record should reflect the foundation, the International Support and Coordination Office (GFISCO), or the overall initiative. 

Additional review from curators is needed in order to make a determination about how we should proceed.

comment_text: The initiative has a Wikidata id (Q49984485); GFISCO's website is under the initiative website. Both GFISCO and the GFF are used as affiliations. The GFF website claims they support GFISCO (among other things) and points to the initiative website for that.

I think from all the above that GFF acts like a top-level organization here, and given that the request specifically asked for the foundation to be recognized and it is actually an organization (as opposed to a project or initiative) I think that does make the most sense. So yes let's create a ROR id for the GO FAIR Foundation as requested here.

Their website seems awfully slow from here, it's a little hard to find out much more about them. I couldn't find any third-party references to them either. Nevertheless, given the location and stated purpose in support of education and research I think this deserves benefit of the doubt here for now, we can add it.

comment_text: This is a legacy issue from 2020. The organization was suggested by the Swiss National Science Foundation to identify affiliations in SNSF-funded research. ROR recommended the addition to GRID but the addition was not approved at the time so the request has been on hold since then. I am now reinstating it so we can consider it for inclusion in ROR. 

The organization is a nonprofit affiliated with the Uniting Church in Australia. It appears that most of the organization's research publications are associated with the Uniting Medically Supervised Injection Centre (Uniting MSIC). We should consider whether to create a ROR ID for Uniting or for Uniting MSIC.

comment_text: Yes, I think we should have something for this. How about creating a ROR id for the overall church (Uniting Church in Australia)? We do have https://ror.org/04m5qh397 for the Church of England, for example and a number of others (https://ror.org/03vpkt967, https://ror.org/012hhd379, etc.)

Uniting MSIC seems to be one service provided in Sydney (https://www.uniting.org/community-impact/uniting-medically-supervised-injecting-centre--msic) - I guess it is used as an affiliation the way some hospitals and clinics would be, and we have plenty of those, so I suppose a ROR id for that would be ok too.

However, ""Uniting"" as a whole seems to be responsible for a lot more services than just this MSIC, particularly care for the aged and mental health care. It's a little hard to search for research from them as ""Uniting"" is hardly a unique string to search on. Their ""Research and Innovation"" page here: https://www.uniting.org/community-impact/research-and-innovation lists a wide variety of research projects they are involved with, with relations with about two dozen universities. So it seems to me that this organization in itself should qualify for a ROR id as a research-involved nonprofit/medical care organization.

So my recommendation is to add a ROR id for Uniting as requested in this issue, and then consider additional ROR id's for a parent (Uniting Church in Australia) and child (Uniting MSIC, Sydney).

comment_text: Australian children's hospital with solid affiliation usage. Independent, top-level entity. Lots of children's hospitals in ROR, so this is in scope. Related hospital, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, closed in 2018, so I will create a deprecation request for that organization.

comment_text: Yes, this seems to have been created as a replacement for the Princess Margaret one. When we deprecate it would be nice if there was a way to indicate the new one as a replacement somehow. Otherwise no objections to creating this new record.

Oh I notice ISNI has a ""Perth Childrens' Hospital Foundation"" - 0000 0004 6085 514X and several records for sub-units of the hospital, but nothing for the hospital itself. Not sure what the relationship is there but I guess we can leave ISNI out of this for now.

comment_text: Not clear this qualifies as a ""top-level"" institution - it's part of UTM (which is part of CSIC), and the website is under the UTM domain. The two ""parent"" organizations listed are just UTM and CSIC. UTM is in Barcelona as is this center.

HOWEVER - the UTM website makes absolutely no mention of CNDP other than listing 4 staff in Antarctica, and it appears CNDP was established before UTM in its current incarnation (2000). So I'm inclined to go ahead and agree this should be treated as an independent organization that should have its own ROR id.

Funds and employs researchers (https://www.institutosaphir.cl/investigadores/). In scope for ROR.

comment_text: If we add this, I assume the official full Spanish name (Adam mentioned above) should be among the labels? SAPHIR seems an unfortunate acronym as it has been used previously for a (unrelated I think) particle detector and is also a surname and real word in some languages, so difficult to narrow down this as an affiliation by searching for this.

I did find some English-language papers using the name ""Millennium Institute for Subatomic Physics at High-Energy Frontier - SAPHIR"" as an affiliation - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.03256.pdf and https://doi.org/10.1140/epjc/s10052-021-09535-5

So yes this should be in ROR.

comment_text: This is a legacy request that ROR received from DMPTool in 2020. DMPTool requested the ROR ID in order to be able to connect JFSP to the research projects that it funds. We were not able to process the request at that time because the record had previously been deprecated by GRID and was not likely to be reinstated. I am re-opening the request so that we can review it for a future ROR release. I recommend adding to ROR because it is an identified funder associated with published research. It is distinct from the Department of the Interior (the record that GRID redirected it to) because it is jointly operated by both DOI and the US Forest Service.

comment_text: Research institute that is a part of the Universidade Lueji A'Nkonde. Not a top-level entity, but does have affiliation usage that references only the institute (vs. institute + university). Examples:
https://revistas.ipls.ao/index.php/kulongesa-tes/article/download/314/164 ; https://revistas.ipls.ao/index.php/kulongesa-tes/article/download/224/155

Finding it hard to make a determination on this as there appears little to go on about the institute's degree of independence. University itself needs to be added to ROR and would be in scope, for which I will create an issue.

comment_text: Yes definitely we should have an entry for Universidade Lueji A'Nkonde. 

From the ""about"" page here: https://www.ipls.ao/?page_id=835 (if I'm reading the Google translation correctly) it appears this institute was originally created and ""attached"" to a different university - ""Universidade Agostinho Neto"" - https://ror.org/0057ag334 - so I think given that it has had in some sense two parents (?) it qualifies as sufficiently independent to be listed separately. Also some of the affiliation usage does not mention the Lueji A'Nkonde connection, and the website differs. So yes I think both that university and this institute should have ROR ids.

comment_text: Argentinian university established in 2018 through a legislative act by the autonomous, district-level government of Buenos Aires. No publication affiliation usage I can find, although a fair amount of secondary academic references to the organization. It's not exactly too new or out of scope for ROR, but at a nebulous threshold of being established because of the lack of research outputs.

I'd lean toward inclusion, but also happy to reach out to the organization to clarify their need for a ROR ID at this point in their development.

Since neither broader affiliation is used on publications when referencing this organization (e.g. https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-0686), I think this in scope.

comment_text: @adambuttrick , I can see you took a different route than the one originally planned in #433, but this one is also fine.
Now just https://ror.org/00angvn73 is having a small scratch, the name ""Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences"" should probably become ""Czech Academy of Sciences, Institute of Biophysics"" in order to follow the same pattern.

comment_text: @jdvorak001 Yes, the Library of the CAS sent us a list of official English forms just before the release, so we had to defer to these. https://ror.org/00angvn73 should have been included, but it looks as if it slipped out in error. I will create a new issue to correct. We've moved to an incremental update model, so we should be able to correct in the next month or so (vs. waiting until next quarter).

comment_text: Good morning, 

I am librarian from Library of the Czech Academy of Sciences Katerina Janderova. 
I have to explain what happened and how our institution works.

Czech Academy of Sciences has about 53 institutes.
They are independent institutions, but Library of CAS is something like methodological centre for institutional libraries.
We discussed change of names with Mr. Dvorak but then Institute of Czech Literature sent you the table with official affiliations.

Both variants are correct but it is possible that other institutions will want to change their names in future - we have more variants of the names.

So now we can leave it like this but there is the problem about Institute of Biophysics - there are two records:

https://ror.org/034g04n73 I think this is not Czech Academy of Science, but Bulgarian Academy according to GRID, including wrong web address.
https://ror.org/00angvn73 this is our Institute of Biophysics of the Czech Academy of Sciences

Another problem is that our Czech Academy of Sciences, Biology Centre has five institutes - they are not in the table so they were not changed.
there are:
https://ror.org/039nazg33 Institute of Entomology
https://ror.org/0436nxt45  Institute of Hydrobiology (ASCR)
https://ror.org/05rhyza23 Institute of Parasitology
[https://ror.org/00jr65m43 ](https://ror.org/00jr65m43)Institute of Plant Molecular Biology
 https://ror.org/02tz8r820 Institute of Soil Biology
 
You can change them to Czech Academy of Sciences, Institute of ….

https://ror.org/02tc3qm58 Technology Centre - this is an old institute, does not exist anymore
we can delete it or give it status non active.

Also Czech Academy of Sciences, Institute of Czech literature wrote me that there was no change in ¨their ISNI -  https://ror.org/01vr20t27  correct ISNI is https://isni.org/isni/0000000121095895

Sorry about the trouble with our official names and so on and thank you and Mr. Dvorak for your help.
We can put these proposals to the form if you want.

Best regards

Katerina Janderova,
Library of the Czech Academy of Sciences

I believe we have a display bug in the search UI where it shows the first value from the ""all"" field in this record, as opposed to the preferred value. I will file an issue with our dev team to get this corrected.

comment_text: The Technology Centre, https://ror.org/02tc3qm58, https://www.tc.cz/en, is still alive and kicking. 

Regarding their relationship with the CAS — quoting from their own webpage, https://www.tc.cz/en/about-us :

> The Technology Centre of the CAS is a non-profit association of legal entities, it is not an institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences according to Act No. 283/1992 Coll., and it is not funded by the budget of the Czech Academy of Sciences. The outputs of the Technology Centre of the CAS contain independent expert opinions and do not express the official position of the Czech Academy of Sciences or individual members of the association.

While they never were one of the CAS institutes, they were formed with stakes of some those institutes (but there were other stakes, too) and were given the name with the ""... of the CAS"" ending, which has turned out to be misleading in the long run.

comment_text: @adambuttrick , thank you. Those five institutes had existed as independent institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences in the past. In 2006 they were merged to form the Biology Centre and they seem to continue their existence as divisions within that centre (cf. https://www.bc.cas.cz/en/about-us/ and the organizational structure chart file). I'd therefore suggest having the Biology Centre (https://ror.org/05pq4yn02) as the parent, not the entire CAS.

Hi Adam,

thank you for your patience.
I have got answer from director of Biology center: they want to have just one ROR for whole institution - Biology Centre, because the five institutes -  Institute of Entomology https://ror.org/0436nxt45 - Institute of Hydrobiology (ASCR), https://ror.org/05rhyza23 - Institute of Parasitology, https://ror.org/00jr65m43 - Institute of Plant Molecular Biology, https://ror.org/02tz8r820 - Institute of Soil Biology
they are now just departments.

ROR - https://ror.org/05pq4yn02
They want to have these names - the primary name - Biology Centre of the Czech Academy of Sciences, 
other names - Biologické centrum AV ČR, v. v. i.; Czech Academy of Sciences, Biology Centre; BC AV ČR

If you can change Czech website to English - https://www.bc.cas.cz/en/homepage/
add wikidata Q8310408 please.

Generally, we would want to deprecate the existing record and create a new one to represent the merged organizations. But since the other merged museum was never included in ROR, I think its fine to update the existing record.

After reviewing https://github.com/ror-community/ror-api/issues/246, I think the best option is to add ""CHU Rennes"" as an alias, which I see in use in various places. I can't find any use of ""CHUR,"" but we could add that as well. 

I do however think that the affiliation search shouldn't fail because of ""de"" in the alias and the user is right that this is an error/improvement needed in our handling. The normal query route handles this fine and returns the expected organization as the first result:

comment_text: Current name in ROR corresponds to the name used on the organization's website and branding. Request here would be to add some subset of the ISNI names (many are minor variants with overlapping text) as aliases. This is probably fine, but not certain about the provenance of ISNI name data.

comment_text: I submitted this request and i think the many names stem from the fact that this organisation is quite old and has had rebrands.
CNAMTS or (Caisse nationale de l'assurance maladie des travailleurs salariés) was the original name from what i gather when it was created. [Ameli](https://www.ameli.fr/) is the name of there website and the main brand for them for french citizens.

Also, and this is quite annoying but CNAM can either be : 
- [**le** CNAM](https://www.cnam.fr/) ; https://ror.org/0175hh227
- [**la** CNAM](https://assurance-maladie.ameli.fr/qui-sommes-nous/organisation/cnam-tete-reseau)
 
a lot of people use CNAM to designate the second one as seen in these : 
- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35752614/
- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31569513/
- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29799296/

comment_text: - **Ameli** is very common among regular french citizens and not researchers as much but i think it would make sense to add it nonetheless
- **CNAMTS** is an old ACRONYM but i think still used and was used in old papers as far as i gather.
- **CNAM** is necessary as most of the time this will be the main ACRONYM used by researchers 
- **French National Health Insurance** could also be another one added.

comment_text: Anti-child exploitation advocacy and treatment organization in Columbia. I'm not seeing much in the way of affiliation usage, although there are several references to the organization from researchers outside it such that I think they are providing some kind of research support or access to others(e.g. https://repositorio.unicartagena.edu.co/handle/11227/4753; https://intellectum.unisabana.edu.co/handle/10818/4133). Their director, Luz Stella Cárdenas Ovalle, has also written [book chapters](https://argumentos.xoc.uam.mx/index.php/argumentos/article/view/34/33) in the organization's focus area. In addition to the report linked in the request, they also publish [diagnostic guidelines and statistical reports](diagnostic guidelines and statistical reports), so I think they are just past the threshold of being in scope.

comment_text: Maybe marginal (the ORCID affiliation was for 1 month!), but I think this counts as a health-care organization and we generally allow those in ROR whether or not they do a lot of research. It's been established for well over a decade and seems to have a pretty sizable staff. So yes let's add to ROR.

comment_text: According to the National Standardization Agency of Indonesia's org chart, this is a sub-unit of the main standardization office, which would lean toward it being out of scope (not a top-level entity):

https://bsn.go.id/main/berita/detail/11204/struktur-organisasi

But it looks like we have some precedent for sub-entity directorates in ROR (https://ror.org/search?query=directorate), for which this organization has two (Direktorat Standar Nasional Satuan Ukuran Mekanika, Radiasi, dan Biologi and the Direktorat Standar Nasional Satuan Ukuran Termoelektrik dan Kimia). Likewise, this likely fits our facility acknowledgement use case. Moving to Second Review for further consideration by the curation team.

comment_text: Yeah I think usually we're pretty generous in allowing subsidiaries of government agencies to have their own ROR id's if they are sufficiently involved in research. In this case I can find a list a couple of hundred papers with Google Scholar that seem to have this specific affiliation, so I do think it qualifies. Let's add it to ROR.

Solid affiliation usage for various branches in the Philippine Science High School System and we likewise have plenty of high schools in ROR (https://ror.org/search?query=High+School). My only question would be whether we should add the system itself as the top-level entity, as opposed to this specific branch. It seems if we add one branch we would need to [the other 15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_Science_High_School_System#Campuses).

While ROR will not establish as a general policy the indexing of the primary name as a label, the need here, in the context of an integration, is sensible.

comment_text: Hmm, when I search the exact proposed name on Google Scholar I get a lot of hits:
https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=30&q=%22Suzhou+institute+of+North+China+Electric+Power+University%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,33
However they all appear to be publications in Chinese journals, which can be downloaded only from CNKI (and I don't have access)?
I think this is a major research institute, well-established (since at least 2012, I don't know where the 2021 date came from in the input data) and it is physically separate from the main university. On the other hand their website domain is a subdomain of the main university site, and there's no sign they have another ""parent"" organization besides the university. So if we were including non-top-level institutes then I think this should definitely be in ROR; as it is it probably is out of scope. But maybe needs further discussion? If we had somebody more familiar with Chinese organizations that might help here!

@arthurpsmith Good catch. I had assumed these were errant as they did not appear in the author affiliations or the page source of the CNKI pages. After subtracting out the CNKI articles that were polluting the Google Scholar results, I was able to find ""Suzhou institute of North China Electric Power University"" as an affiliation in IEEE (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6330107 ; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6896157 ; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6330107), with the only caveat being that the author's profiles use the university affiliation, not the institute (e.g., https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37304066300 ; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37405735500 ; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38543674000).

The publication page (https://journals.4science.ge/) lists journals, but I wasn't able to find the Association for Science as an affiliation. Some of the journals do not yet have any issues. This may be a new organization that is still getting started. I was unable to find much about the organization in Google or Wikipedia, but that may be because it's a common name.

https://journals.4science.ge/

What they appear to be doing is running an OJS platform for a number of Georgian e-journals, which may not be exactly the same thing as publishing them (most have origins at Georgian universities). We should discuss further whether this use case is in scope for ROR.

There seems to be a slight discrepancy between the ""Theater"" documentation center and the general one for  ""Scenic Arts and Music"" - the ""Theater"" one with its separate website is what is linked in the wikipedia page they provided,  but I think it evolved into the more general one?

Everything on the site lists them as still in the process of becoming active, so it's hard to assess their status as a top-level entity.

That being said, does appear to be a joint project between https://ror.org/048bdy921 and https://ror.org/02k7v4d05, as their board is comprised of members from both groups, as well as others unaffiliated with either organization.

comment_text: I have not been able to find this used as an affiliation. Their main website does not seem to work correctly - the English pages are gibberish, and the Macedonian ones don't seem to interlink for the most part? The organization appears to be primarily the publisher of the Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences - https://oamjms.eu/ - this does publish a substantive number of articles every year and has been around for a while. And the organization does have an ISNI entry. So I suppose on those grounds it qualifies for ROR, but I think it's a marginal case.

comment_text: I am also not finding affiliation use for this organization. I did find an instance of this organization funding research (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6684436/). Other than affiliation use the organization seems to be in scope. One other note – I am not finding any information on who runs the organization on their website. Most of the links lead to empty web pages. I agree with Arthur that this is on the margins. Moving to Needs discussion.

comment_text: This is a new publisher based in Tehran (website says it started up in 2021). It has at least one journal that has published some articles, which is what they link. I believe this probably doesn't qualify given that we are not planning to create ROR id's for all small publishers. However we could wait and see on this. Note the Wikidata ID mentioned has been deleted due to insufficient information.

comment_text: Related organization (https://ror.org/02weea238) is ""FOAM"" but includes ""FOAM KERNOW"" as an alias and the website is https://fo.am/kernow/. The FoAM Kernow studio is no longer an active organization name (superseded by ""Then Try This""). Also, I don't think under current ROR scope policies that the Kernow child organization would be added, and that we would add the parent organization, FoAM, instead. Update existing ROR record to represent the top-level organization, FoAM? Moving to needs discussion.

comment_text: I'm seeing a lot of historic affiliation usage for FoAM Kernow:

https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000258
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/mec.14528
https://www.uaconferences.org/docs/UACE2017_Papers/897_UACE2017.pdf
https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2020.2823

Likewise, FoAM Kernow was located in a different country from FoAM (UK vs. Belgium) and was replaced by another organization (""Then Try This""), with both ""Then Try This"" and the broader FoAM organization still being active. If we updated FoAM Kernow to represent FoAM, users would have no way to retroactively index these records, nor could we represent the ""Then Try This"" supercession.

My recommendation would be that we deprecate FoAM Kernow record and create a new record for the FoAM parent body and create a relationship between the two.

comment_text: Scholarly communications company focused on new models for the dissemination of biological research. Relatively new organization with no affiliation usage that I can see, although principals are all well-credentialed with solid academic history. I think what they will do is in scope for ROR, although current outputs are limited.

How should the record(s) be changed?  Dear ROR team,

I suggest that an entry in the ROR database be created for the French committee of IUCN (Comité Français de l'UICN) as a subset of that of IUCN (04tehfn33). This could be an entry similar to that of the Guinea-Bissau and other national committees that already have an entry.
I would like to specify that I am only a member of the committee and that I am not acting here officially on behalf of the French committee. It is just a personal suggestion.

Best regards,

Luis

comment_text: Requestor is correct that we have inherited national sub-entities of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (e.g. https://ror.org/01szdrn56 ; https://ror.org/00yq23r19), so this is likely in scope by that precedent. There is likewise affiliation usage that references this form as well (https://hal.inrae.fr/hal-02790488) and the committee appears to be a long-standing organization (founded in 1901).

Separately, all of these records should be cleaned up, with their names updated to reflect them as national manifestations of the parent body, with the creation of corresponding relationships. I will create a separate issue for this.

The site features two additional publications, for which ""[Seven Past Nine] contributed as main authors,"" both of which were authored by one of the CEOs and use a different affiliation (Edelweiss Connect).

comment_text: The article referenced in the ""Link to Publications"" is here:  doi:10.1001/jamaneurol.2021.0428 - this is a ""Viewpoint"" article, not a regular research article. Also it doesn't refer to LMSA as an affiliation but (as far as I can see) only in this sentence: ""... long-established organizations (eg, American Academy of Neurology, Student National Medical Association, Latino Medical Student Association) have sponsored virtual specialty panels to increase information access for their members.""

The request mentions articles surveying LMSA members, but that still doesn't seem to really fall into the scope of ROR. While this seems to be a worthwhile organization in what it does, I don't think it needs or qualifies for a ROR id.

comment_text: Joint pharmacoepidemiological research institute by the [University of Bordeaux](https://ror.org/057qpr032), its [research hospital](https://ror.org/01hq89f96 ), and its sub-entity the [Bergonié Institute](https://ror.org/02yw1f353). Not a top-level entity, but a kind of joint project between several in-scope orgs. Used as a [primary affiliation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26017643/) on works where the University of Bordeaux is also used as affiliation, as well as as a [leading affiliation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26301735/) for the university. From the affiliation usage, it looks as if there is a distinction that needs to be made for tracking research outputs, so I would say this is likely in scope, but would like to hear other's thoughts.

 I'm not seeing anything in the way of affiliation usage, but they do publish annual reports on their activities and are acknowledged as a research partner in the work of others (e.g. https://static1.squarespace.com/static/600e896f2c69ea16574e97ff/t/62b03c76e6de1c6182898bd1/1655716983341/Dahlia19+Synthesisreport_June+22+.pdf), so I believe they are in scope for ROR.

comment_text: The requestor has also indicated that we treat this and other ERIC organizations with the type ""Government"" because of the ERIC designation being conferred by the EU. I think this is fine, as it's preferable to the more ambiguous ""Other"" designation and most of these organizations exist beyond the level of individual facilities. But other curation team members, please weigh in with your thoughts.

comment_text: Since 2020, has published a single open access journal, [Jurnal Ekologi, Masyarakat dan Sains](https://journals.ecotas.org/) (Journal of Ecology, Society and Science, ISSN: 2720-9717). I'd advise reviewing organization there as their main site appears infected with malware. Would be in scope per our small publisher use case.
