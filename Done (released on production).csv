comment_text: I added the ISNI for this research institute; they have a slightly different English version of the name - ""Biomedical Research Network Centre in Respiratory Diseases"", maybe that should be another alias?

Also note that the type for the sibling organizations is listed as ""Facility""; that may be more appropriate than ""government"" here, I think we generally use ""Facility"" for research institutes like this one.

And yes, this should definitely be in ROR.

comment_text: Per organization website (https://www.hereon.de/innovation_transfer/communication_media/news/100319/index.php.en): ""Today the Helmholtz-Zentrum Geesthacht – Centre for Materials and Coastal Research GmbH has been renamed the Helmholtz-Zentrum hereon GmbH."" Organization name in ROR should be updated. Not sure if primary name should be updated to ""Helmholtz-Zentrum hereon GmbH"" or ""Helmholtz-Zentrum hereon"" (sans ""GmbH""). News release includes the GmbH but other data sources such as organization's main webpage, Wikipedia, ISNI do not include the GmbH. Moving to Needs discussion.

The website link at ROR still resolves, but has also been updated and should be changed to ""https://www.hereon.de/index.php.en""

comment_text: I think we would generally leave out the GmbH in the main name, but the new full name with that included should be added as an alias. If you search ror.org right now for 'GmbH' you'll find many matches but only a small fraction include the 'GmbH' in the main display name. We maybe should have a policy on this, but generally I think ""co."", ""ltd."", ""AB"" etc. legal-entity-type suffixes should probably go in aliases as a general rule, not in the main name we display unless the organization always includes that part of their official name.

However, the existing link in the ROR record (http://www.pntu.com.ua/) resolves to a site where the old name is still present (Poltava National Technical University).

But yes it is clearly the same university - the address is identical, and the same ""Yuri Kondratyuk"" is there on the old website at least on this page: http://www.pntu.com.ua/university/scientific-technical-library/ which uses the name ""Poltava National Technical Yuri Kondratyuk University"". I'm guessing the old website is still there because it's in English (and http not https?)
So I agree with the above recommended change. Also maybe we should add the Ukrainian official name (from the new website): Національний університет «Полтавська політехніка імені Юрія Кондратюка»

While those 3 principles (or others with the same name) have published research, none of them (that I could find on Google Scholar at least) used this organization as the affiliation. Also I don't see any other research outputs of this organization at the moment. I recommend we put this one on hold until 2022 and re-evaluate at that point.

comment_text: Definitely a medical research organization. The publication list link is for their self-published items and newsletters though. They seem to have subsidiaries in other African countries too (Uganda)? But I found a number of articles that use the South Africa organization as affiliations - example: https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(14)01249-1/abstract

So yes, let's add this.

comment_text: This looks good to me too! I'm wondering about the location. I went to check if they had a Ringgold ID, and I found 7 locations in South Africa with different Ringgold IDs/ISNIs:

Should we list all 7 Ringgold IDs/ISNIs under the same record? The ISNI provided is for the Richmond location, not Johannesburg--and it doesn't look like there is one for Johannesberg.

comment_text: I agree with the proposed changes here - the ISNI clearly refers to the Frankfurt, Germany location (there is also another ISNI for the international RISM organization but that doesn't belong on this record either) so the ISNI entry should be removed. I also made a note of the associated Wikidata ID for this Swiss office. I do wonder whether we should have another ROR id for the German office and/or the international organization, but if it hasn't been requested by anybody I suppose that's not urgent.

comment_text: looks good. 

English name ""Institute for Nanophotonics"" and acronym should be safed in the metadata.

Wikidata could also be added: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q1806526

comment_text: Verified at Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_French_Antilles

> It [University of the French West Indies and Guiana] was previously part of a larger institution in combination with campuses in French Guiana known as the University of the French West Indies and Guiana. As a result of funding disputes, that university was separated into two distinct institutions based on its constituent parts in French Guiana and the Lesser Antilles respectively. The separation process was completed by 1 January 2015.

There is already en entry in ROR for University of French Guiana: https://ror.org/00nb39k71. Therefore, to make the registry current, we should rename the existing record for University of the French West Indies and Guiana. 

According to Wikipedia and the university website, I believe the name should be: University of the French Antilles (fr: Université des Antilles).

comment_text: I agree with Maria on what the new name should be (what is missing from ROR right now). As this is a split it seems like we should somehow deprecate this record and create a new one with the new name? But maybe just changing the name as proposed here is ok.
