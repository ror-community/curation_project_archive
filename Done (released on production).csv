Other information about this request: Banner MD Anderson Cancer Center has a flagship location in Gilbert, AZ on the campus of Banner Gateway Medical Center. However, the Banner MD Anderson Cancer Center has opened at several other Banner Medical Centers ( see https://www.bannerhealth.com/locations?search=submit&query=Banner%20MD%20Anderson%20Cancer%20Center). Instead of creating an identifier for each location I suggest including other locations as alternative names. ","ror-curator-bot

Our website appears to be down for maintenance/upgradation. I need to talk to IT department about what's going on.
However, I can add multiple affiliations and website of the institute journal.

This is the website of the Journal of Universal College of Medical Sciences - https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/JUCMS/index

comment_text: Request here is a bit confusing as the new entity referred to as Dulaty University appears to continue to use a variant form of the name on https://ror.org/014kyp779 (see: https://dulaty.kz/en/about-us/history-of-university.html#). Merger is referenced on the organization's site (""structure"" section [here](https://dulaty.kz/en/study/pre-university-education)) and so should be handled in some fashion. I suppose a new record for the combined entity may be best, but I want to confirm that others don't think we should update and fold into https://ror.org/014kyp779.

comment_text: The history of the wikipedia page - https://kk.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%D0%9C%D2%B1%D1%85%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BC%D0%B5%D0%B4_%D0%A5%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%80_%D0%94%D1%83%D0%BB%D0%B0%D1%82%D0%B8_%D0%B0%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B0%D2%93%D1%8B_%D0%A2%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B7_%D3%A9%D2%A3%D1%96%D1%80%D0%BB%D1%96%D0%BA_%D1%83%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%80%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%96&action=history - shows this was moved from the old ""Taraz State University"" label to the new ""Regional University"" label, so there is a case based on that for reusing the ROR id. I'm not clear on the relative size of the two universities that merged here, but the old ""Pedagogical University"" seems to have been pretty substantial in itself as far as I can tell.

So I think it would be best to create a new ID for the merged entity and set the old ones to inactive, pointing to the new id.
