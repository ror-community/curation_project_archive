comment_text: In scope with multiple instances of affiliation use found at Google Scholar, add to ROR. Edited primary name from ""Institute for Social and Political Psychology"" to ""Institute of Social and Political Psychology"" to match the name listed in English version of the organization's website (using website's language dropdown option). @adambuttrick - Less clear on how to handle the label. I think it should be changed to ""Інститут соціальної та політичної психології"" with the ""НАПН України"" removed as that portion translates to ""of the National Academy of Educational Sciences of Ukraine"".

Provides datasets and produces reports on the related to the resources under their charge (e.g., https://doi.org/10.48799). I can't find them yet on Datacite, so I believe the request for a ROR ID may be part of their move to the platform.

Not certain whether to use the form provided for the primary name. Mailing address on their site simply list ""L’eau des collines."" I believe SPL is an abbreviation for ""Société publique locale du pays d'Aubagne et de l'Etoile.""

comment_text: Ok, it's about 10 years old, and it does seem to be somewhat involved in research. Given that we've added a few similar organizations previously I think this is fine. While SPL is a type-of-organization abbreviation it appears to be a relatively limited and new one (the website mentions it's from a law dated May 2010) so I think it's ok in this case to leave it as part of the name as they requested.

comment_text: I added wikipedia/wikidata/ISNI id's.

This appears to be a relatively new museum in the Netherlands, and has gone  through several names - the English wikipedia page mentions ""Jannink Museum of Textiles and Social Life""  and ""TwentseWelle"" as previous names. From their website they appear to be closely related to (share governance with) ""Rijksmuseum Twenthe"", a much more well-established museum in the same city, which also does not seem to be in ROR.

""Rijksmuseum Twenthe"" seems to be well-referenced in research literature, though not as an affiliation.  I couldn't find any references to ""De MuseumFabriek"", or  ""The MuseumFactory"", perhaps because those  names are relatively new. I  did find  some ""TwentseWelle"" references (but again not as affiliations).

This seems to be a borderline case to me. Perhaps we should put it on hold for now, given the newness of the name. If we do add a ROR id for this we should definitely also add one for ""Rijksmuseum Twenthe"", with which it is related.

As the prior org was in scope, I see no reason why this should not be, despite it being relatively young and the lack of affiliation usage.

comment_text: I see. Yes, I think in these cases it's safest to create a new ID - for ROR and ISNI and Wikidata should do so also. Presumably it hasn't happened there yet because the change was made only in the German language Wikipedia, and they just moved the article to a new name rather than creating a new one.

Have you come to any conclusions on what to do about redirects etc. on the ROR side for a case like this?

comment_text: KAGRA appears to be associated with the Gravitational Wave Group at the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research, which is based at the University of Tokyo. There is a list of related publications here: https://www.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/gr/GWPOHPe/reports-e.html. 

The ICRR is based at the University of Tokyo, but it is referred to as an ""inter-university research institute"" (https://www.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/about-icrr-2/directors-greetings/). I think it's sufficiently independent that we could add the ICRR to ROR, but I'm not sure if KAGRA is in scope. Do we have other examples of facilities like this in ROR?

If we do add KAGRA, we might want to add some of the other ICRR facilities listed here: https://www.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/facility/.

Moving to ""needs discussion"".

comment_text: Ah, good to point that out. The KAGRA website is under ICRR's domain, but as it notes: ""KAGRA is hosted by the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research (ICRR), the University of Tokyo, and co-hosted by the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) and National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ)"" so it's not purely part of University of Tokyo.
Among the ""ICRR facilities"", I believe CTA does have a ROR id already (and is also not just a U Tokyo facility): https://ror.org/020jy7109
Kamioka Observatory I think also deserves one, it's a major physics research facility that's been operating for decades. Not sure about the others.
That said, ICRR is a pretty major institute in its own right and maybe should have a ROR even though it is indeed part of U Tokyo. It does seem to have its own Crossref Funder ID: https://doi.org/10.13039/501100013260

Judging by this, I believe ICRR is in scope, as well as the Kamioka Observatory. KAGRA is a little more nebulous, as it is related to Kamioka Observatory, but also conducts independent research using its own equipment and hosts conferences. On the ICRR site, Kamioka and KAGRA are also listed as separate facilities: https://www.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/facility/

comment_text: This is a legacy issue from 2020 that came to ROR via Dryad. ROR suggested it to GRID but the addition was not approved. I am reopening the request so we can reconsider it for inclusion in ROR. This research institute is affiliated with the University of Cape Town but it was established as a nonprofit and appears to have independent staff and research activities. I would recommend we consider it for inclusion in ROR.

comment_text: This is a legacy request from 2020. The request came from Dryad for the purpose of identifying datasets created by Peabody-affiliated researchers. ROR submitted it to GRID for inclusion but it was not approved by GRID at the time. I am reinstating the request now so that we can create the entry in ROR. The museum is affiliated with Yale University but per our criteria for inclusion regarding museums affiliated with universities, I think we should proceed with creating a separate ID.

comment_text: @mariagould is it acceptable/preferable for users to create issues directly rather than go via the web form? 
I saw the ""new issue"" button and that there were two templates and assumed it was ok. Speaking personally, creating it here is easier than the form, and I know I will then be following updates automatically rather than having to come into Git after doing the webform, find the issue, and then follow it. ps I should also say that the issue auto-assigned to you when it was created

comment_text: @icraig-afk Adam Buttrick, here. I'm ROR's new Metadata Curation Lead. Yes, you may submit record requests using the new and update issue templates. It's not currently our preferred method for all requests, as we have issues with data completeness in requests that the form helps mitigate. But for those that are active within ROR community and know our ins and outs better than most, submitting via Github is fine as well. Please let me know if you have any questions about using the issue templates themselves.
