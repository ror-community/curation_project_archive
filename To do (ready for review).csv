comment_text: Not certain what to make of this request, as it conflicts directly with what the organization asserted in https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/issues/1798. If legally, https://ror.org/04jjbs468 and https://ror.org/045n75910 are the same organization https://ror.org/04jjbs468 should mostly likely be withdrawn. It also conflicts with what https://ror.org/045n75910 says [here](https://ul.org/news/ul-enterprise-launches-new-brands). The [Legal Entity Identifier entry](https://search.gleif.org/#/record/549300F5SST3PP8Y6X77) also has the parent org as active, so I don't think we're dealing with a predecessor successor-situation.

comment_text: I am also confused by this request. UL Solutions (https://ror.org/045n75910) identifies UL Research Institutes (https://ror.org/04jjbs468) as a separate organization [here](https://www.ul.com/ulsolutions). Additionally, they have separate leadership teams:

- UL Solutions: https://www.ul.com/about/leadership
- UL Research Institutes: https://ul.org/about#leadership-team

@adambuttrick – Reach out to the requestor for clarification? Otherwise, my stance is keep as two separate organizations with the current parent-child relationship. Leaving in Second Review for now.

comment_text: I would also suggest reaching out to the requestor and maybe looping in the requestor for #1798 (if they are not the same person). 

Based on my interpretation of the situation, I think the approach (which we can confirm with the requestor) is to have three separate records in ROR: UL Solutions, UL Research Institutes, and UL Standards & Engagement. This aligns with the structure communicated in this press release from last year: https://www.ul.com/news/ul-enterprise-launches-new-brands.

In terms of how this impacts existing records in ROR, this would mean: 
- Rename existing UL record (https://ror.org/045n75910) to ""UL Solutions"" (as per https://www.ul.com/ulsolutions, ""UL is now UL Solutions"")
- Retain existing record for UL Research Institutes (https://ror.org/04jjbs468)
- Create new record for UL Standards & Engagement
- Set up ""related"" relationships between the three records
- Withdraw UL Germany record (https://ror.org/04dpwfd08) (in my opinion, it should never have been created) and point to UL Solutions as successor org

comment_text: Research foundation associated with https://ror.org/01e8d4510. Relationship to https://ror.org/01e8d4510 is ambiguous, as the self-description would seem to apply equally to https://ror.org/01e8d4510 as the foundation. I can likewise find no funding or affiliation references for this, so my suspicion is that this should just be treated as equivalent to https://ror.org/01e8d4510.

@icraig-afk How is this used in the Wiley context? Is there affiliation usage that is not being surfaced here?

comment_text: Amazon rain forest monitoring and research institute, identified in https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/issues/2445. I'm seeing a fair amount of secondary references to this. Affiliation usage is more limited, but is typically leading for https://ror.org/03ztnr397. Since the request is identifying a specific difficulty with identifying their publication outputs and is located separate from the university parent, I suppose we can add. Seems to serve a similar regional function as the various LTER entities.

comment_text: I'm not seeing a lot of research output from this institute; also it looks like it is always identified as part of UABJB. The website is very minimal, listing only one publication which doesn't even have this as an affiliation. I think this is out of scope for ROR, at least for now.

Description of change: In 2020, two institutes were dissolved and merged to become INRAE - National Research Institute for Agriculture, Food and the Environment.  The research units currently registered in ROR are the former units of the former National Institute for Agricultural Research INRA. With the merger, there were several changes in 2020 and in the years that followed: 

1) new research laboratories were added (those of the former National Institute for Research in Science and Technology IRSTEA) 
2) research units changed their name
3) other research units have been closed or merged. The mergers were done with a name change or by keeping the name of the best known unit. Records of units that have been closed or absorbed should continue to appear in the registry but with a status indicating that they are no longer active. Search tools such as OpenAlex or Semantic Scholar rely on your registry for searches covering their period of existence. I assume this is something you are used to dealing with.

Finally, I would like to mention that a large number of our research laboratories have several institutional parents; this is today the case for all French public research and higher education institutions.

How would you like us to provide you with the necessary information? 
Could you also tell me if you have a current contact in our institution or if you had contacts in previous institutes? I prefer not to infringe on a colleague's prerogative.
