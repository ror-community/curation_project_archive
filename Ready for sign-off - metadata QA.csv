comment_text: Original request was for Weill Cornell Medical College, a sub-entity of both Weill Cornell Medicine and Cornell itself. I believe the appropriate record here would be for Weill Cornell Medicine, which includes both the hospital and its medical college. Conversely, we have the precedent of [Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar](https://ror.org/05v5hg569), which would indicate that the NYC college is also in scope. Would like to hear others thoughts. Weill Cornell Medicine previously existed as grid.471410.7/https://ror.org/02r109517, before it was removed by GRID when we were synced with their data. If added, we would reinstate with these IDs.

While its domain is under the Cornell umbrella, Weill Cornell Medicine is located separate from the main campus and exists in partnership with other NYC area hospitals. Funds and employs researchers and has solid affiliation usage, so would otherwise be in scope.

comment_text: Ooh, absolutely we should have this, a major medical research facility. I guess this was part of GRID's purge of medical schools but it really is very separate from the main university. Also, we have several Cornell ""colleges"" that are colocated in Ithaca as full ROR records (see child organizations on the main Cornell record https://ror.org/05bnh6r87, I guess due to a dual role as a state agricultural university in addition to being a major private liberal arts university. An another note I wonder if we should also have an additional ROR record for Cornell Tech - https://tech.cornell.edu - or maybe just for the ""Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute"" which is a joint institute there with Technion (Israel) as the other parent. See Wikidata record Q5171546 for more on Cornell Tech. Anyway Weill Cornell Medicine should definitely be in ROR. Restoring the old ID would be fine with me.

comment_text: @arthurpsmith How do you feel about the Weill Cornell Medicine Medical College having its own, additional record in that context? Affiliation usage seems that specific in many cases, but it doesn't seem really to be a top-level entity, even if for whatever reason GRID didn't purge the equivalent record in Qatar.

comment_text: As the requester for this one, I want to add a comment. In general. I've been noticing that researchers have trouble with ROR when they are affiliated with a medical school. They have always specified ""medical college"" or ""school of medicine"" and when completing forms during submission, they do the same, using the med school name. We currently allow authors to enter names they wish for their address information, even if autocomplete does not find an entry in ROR. That's becoming a problem for us, and we are going to start requiring a ROR institution. This is surely going to cause issues for authors who insist on using the med school name. I think it would be helpful for medical schools to have distinct but related RORs.

comment_text: @odonner1 Thank you for that additional context. We will take it under advisement in how we address medical schools moving forward.

More generally, we advise against requiring ROR IDs in integrations. There will always be organizations that are out of scope for ROR, but are otherwise appropriate as affiliations. Likewise, we are not always able to add records for organizations at the same pace with which they are being used in various scholarly publishing systems, even if those organizations are in scope for the registry.

comment_text: Understood, and we can talk more offline about how we plan to require, there will be an out. However, ROR is driving our R&P deal eligibility checks as well as our Open Access Switchboard workflow, so it's a real problem when an organization does not have a ROR, or the searchable name differs enough from the ROR entry that authors cannot find the entry, and get frustrated, as with many med schools.

comment_text: @adambuttrick ARM is a DOE User Facility similar to https://ror.org/04xm1d337 and https://ror.org/04rc0xn13. They also host a data repository and are publishing data. ARM is under multiple DOE labs, not just ORNL. I asked them to request a ROR ID because ARM will be registering grant/award DOI with our (DOE OSTI's) service and needs a ROR ID since that will be a required field in the Crossref Grant ID schema.

comment_text: @adambuttrick Tough question. I'd lean toward ""Atmospheric Radiation Measurement User Facility"" since that's what I found on their website and the official DOE Office of Science User Facility website - https://arm.gov/about and https://science.osti.gov/ber/Facilities/User-Facilities/ARM. But, would probably discuss with the submitter since they provided ""Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Data Center"" and that's used in the affiliation.

comment_text: Additional context from the requestor:

""Yes, ARM Data Center supports the US Department of Energy’s Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) User Facility which is operated by 9 US DOE laboratories. This is explained [here](https://arm.gov/about). ARM Data Center archives and distributes data collected by ARM and contributed by PIs to the users around the world. The ARM Data Center is physically located at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, USA. The ARM facility’s Technical Director’s office is located in Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Richland, Washington State.""

From this description, it would appear the data center maybe too far down the organizational hierarchy (Oak Ridge -> ARM User Facility -> ARM Data Center) to qualify for its own ROR ID and should be understood as a department of the ARM User Facility. This corresponds with the data center page being hosted as [subdomain of the main ARM site](https://adc.arm.gov/discovery/).

@carlyrobinson Do you concur or do you think this is more of the ""Needs Discussion"" variety? We could also consider creating separate records for the ARM User Facility and ARM Data Center in a parent/child relationship.

@adambuttrick  - Regarding the hierarchy, I agree it is part of the University of Edinburgh and an MRC-funded facility. However, I am not sure it being ""described as part of the university's Institute of Genetics and Cancer"" is accurate. The [history page](https://www.ed.ac.uk/mrc-human-genetics-unit/about/mrc-hgu-history) indicates the unit is ""a _partner_ [emphasis added] in the Institute of Genetics and Cancer (formerly the Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine) at the University of Edinburgh."" Further, my reading of the publication affiliation use is that some authors are claiming affiliation with both the MRC Human Genetics Unit and the Institute of Genetics and Cancer.

- MRC Human Genetics Unit **and** Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh
- MRC Human Genetics Unit**,** MRC Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, University of Edinburgh

Additionally, my reading of the ""MRC Human Genetics Unit, Western General Hospital"" affiliation is that it is a result of the (somewhat) confusing fact that the unit is physically located within Western General Hospital.

My view: Add to ROR as child of University of Edinburgh and Medical Research Council. Add as related orgs: [Institute of Genetics and Cancer](https://www.ed.ac.uk/institute-genetics-cancer/) (needs to be added to ROR); Western General Hospital (https://ror.org/009kr6r15).

Let me know your thoughts and I will move to the appropriate project column.

comment_text: Similar case as #928, although slightly less hierarchy here. Joint venture between the Medical Research Council and the University of Bristol. From what I see, is used exclusively as a leading affiliation for the University of Bristol, which would lean toward it being out of scope by virtue of not being a top-level entity:

Publication affiliation usage: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/add.12514 ; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.20840 ; https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/add.13298

comment_text: Hmm, the ORCID affiliation listings don't seem to mention University of Bristol, but that may be because of the way ORCID allows users to select things right now.

On the other hand we have a lot of these university-based MRC units in ROR already:
https://ror.org/046vje122
https://ror.org/043j90n04
https://ror.org/05362x394
https://ror.org/015nth639
https://ror.org/052578691
https://ror.org/01vdt8f48
https://ror.org/02kcpr174

etc. etc.
While they are clearly located at universities, and many have websites that are under the university domain, they do have a second parent organization in the MRC. So I lean towards including this one (and the other related ones in the request queue). Moving to ""needs discussion"" as we don't seem to be completely agreed here?

Galgotias College of Engineering & Technology appears to be part of an umbrella organization called, ""Galgotias Campus 1"" which does not have a web presence under this name, but for which ""Galgotias College"" is used as an alias and the requestor has supplied the link. Wikidata ID/Wikipedia URL are for Galgotias Campus 1 entity while ISNI is for the College of Engineering and Technology. I think the appropriate record here would probably be for the Galgotias Campus 1/Galgotias College organization. Publication affiliation usage looks solid for the parent body:

There should be at least one ROR here - maybe two? How about let's start with one that includes both names in aliases etc. and then split if it seems necessary later?

comment_text: German form as primary corresponds to organization's site and branding, but I'm a little hesitant to remove this entirely. While there's no direct affiliation usage I can find, there are a number of references to this English form in various research aggregation systems (e.g. https://www.nature.com/nature-index/institution-outputs/germany/max-planck-institute-for-iron-research-mpie/513906ef34d6b65e6a0016e9 ; https://www.researchgate.net/institution/Max_Planck_Institute_for_Iron_Research_GmbH ; https://amdis.iaea.org/clerval/institutions/mpi-eisenforschung), such that removing may impact discovery.

My suggestion would be that we downgrade the English form to an alias (as opposed to a label).

comment_text: I agree this should be added to ROR given evidence of research activities. 

Metadata note: Where did the English name come from? There are a couple of other ways to translate the name into English (""National Center for Medical Science Information"", ""National Center for Information on Medical Sciences""). I wasn't able to determine if there is an official or most common English version in use.
