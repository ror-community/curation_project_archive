comment_text: Clearly they publish books (and periodicals? I couldn't see their list of periodicals though) in Russian, and provide access electronically. However, I don't see them involved in research directly, and found no sign of the use of ""IPR Books"" or ""IPR Media"" as an affiliation. I think this is not suitable for ROR at this time, at least unless we get further evidence they are used as an affiliation or are involved in research more significantly somehow. Willing to hear somebody else's opinion on this too of course!

comment_text: This is a Ukrainian organization established in 2017/2018 that organizes and publishes the proceedings for an annual conference on mental health. They also publish a peer reviewed open access journal. No affiliation use found. Organization seems to be run by one person, Dr. Viktor Vus. I don't think this organization is in scope, second reviewer may want to move to Needs Discussion. If adding, will also need to discuss metadata. Org name in the request was ""International Platform on Mental Health"", but the name throughout org's website is ""Mental Health: Global Challenges of XXI Century.""

I am the founder of both organizations and am affiliated with the University of Washington in Seattle, WA as a Senior Fellow in the Disability Inclusive Development Initiative and, effective January 2022, Affiliate Assistant Professor in the Law, Societies and Justice Department.  Both BDC and LC are vehicles to bridge the gap between academic research and its practical applications.  I use both to facilitate contracting with external organizations such as UNESCO and Humanity & Inclusion for research particularly into the rights of persons with disabilities.  We are anticipating applying for grants from organizations like SVRI and others and expanding our research profile, for which a ROR ID would be helpful.

comment_text: Generally, we do not assign separate ROR IDs for libraries that are part of a university. This is a policy GRID has held as well. I will be curious to know whether the requestor's GRID ID application ends up getting approved. I would suggest that we discuss this as a group and keep an eye on the next (final) GRID update.

The new institute name is being used as an affiliation in publications, e.g., https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2020.126103.

comment_text: This is a community that hosts annual competitions for undergraduate students to create gene annotations, ran by Texas A&M. Related publications use Texas A&M affiliation.

I searched Google Scholar for  references to the full name (""Community Assessment of Community Annotation with Ontology"") and it is referenced or acknowledged in about a dozen articles, but not used as an affiliation. Searching for the abbreviation CACAO brought up entirely unrelated papers so that wasn't helpful.  Anyway, I don't see this as being in scope for ROR.

comment_text: They have a somewhat nice website and do appear to be some sort of educational organization, but they are not listed in ISNI nor wikimedia sites, nor as a Crossref Funder. Their ""link to publications"" does not list publications, only shows some certificates/awards. Searching Google Scholar for ""ProRelix"" finds nothing with this as an affiliation or anywhere else. It seems to me they are not involved in published research and do not qualify to be included in ROR.

Rather, it includes one award and one certificate that were awarded to the institution. No publications found when searching Google Scholar and Web of Science. I concur with @arthurpsmith - this institution does not appear to be involved in research and therefore does not match criteria [2] for inclusion in ROR (https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates).

The SPDF is one of a very few facilities addressed in our first proof of concept use case, so its record would need to be updated to add the additional type.  

In addition, NASA may already have alternate ID's for each of these facilities, so the ability to add those would be very helpful...  They certainly do for this facility which has the id spase://SMWG/Repository/NASA/GSFC/SPDF

I do note that ideally we'd need the update sooner than 4 months from now...

comment_text: GRID created this record for the UK subsidiary, but there's no record for the US parent. I think we should create a separate ROR record for the parent organization (and link them with our parent/child relationship). The ISNI and Wikipedia page on this record should be moved to the US parent. However the Wikidata ID for the US parent is different: Q6895942.

comment_text: I agree with Arthur's assessment - this ROR ID should stay with the UK subsidiary, and we should create a new ROR record for the US parent.

I noticed this ROR ID is linked to the UK Wikidata ID - https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30290687 - but not the US one. This supports us keeping this ROR for the UK subsidiary, rather than updating it to represent the US parent.

comment_text: Not certain whether this sufficiently constitutes an independent, top-level entity. From the org's ""Publishing"" page:

""The services of Kiel University Publishing are available to all members and affiliates of Kiel University, as described in the constitution. This means that researchers from Kiel University must be involved in all publications, whether as authors or editors. Within the publication projects, they are therefore the main contact persons of the publishing team.""

I can likewise find no affiliation usage for the press itself, which corresponds with the above (authors and editors would likely identify with Kiel University instead). In addition, Kiel University is already represented in ROR (https://ror.org/04v76ef78). We only otherwise seem to have 11 entities with a ""university press"" included in their title (https://ror.org/search?page=1&query=%22university%20press%22), but happy to hear anything else on precedent.

comment_text: Note their contact page says they are ""c/o UniversitÃ¤tsbibliothek Kiel"" - and the about page also mentions the publishing service is provided by the library. So not only is this clearly not an independent ""top-level"" organization, there's another layer between it and the university which we don't have in ROR either (German Wikipedia has an entry for the library at least: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/UniversitÃ¤tsbibliothek_Kiel). So I'm afraid this is definitely out of ROR's current scope. If and when we support subunits of research organizations then this is a likely useful addition, but not right now.

If they are sponsoring research, we would need additional examples. Doesn't appear to be sufficient evidence of research activity at the moment. Recommend being flagged as out of scope.

comment_text: Searching Google Scholar for this name is a little confusing because there seems to be also some sort of device called ""DevScope"" used in research, which appears to be completely unrelated. Anyway, yes the only research articles I could find with this affiliation were by the same person. I agree out of scope for now.

comment_text: Not certain whether this sufficiently constitutes a top-level entity as it is under the Center for Limnology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It's director appears to use the University of Wisconsin affiliation, (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-0lQw-wAAAAJ). Other research station entities in ROR appear to have a greater degree of independence. The North Temperate Lakes US Long-Term Ecological Research Network (https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/), which they cite as supplying data for, also appears to be under the umbrella of the University of Wisconsin.

comment_text: I agree this is not a top-level research organization. At some point we should find a way to support these, but right now out of scope for ROR.

The ISNI entry they reference is also interesting, as it has ""University of Wisconsin Madison Center for Limnology"" as one of the names - but the request lists that as a parent. So things are a bit mixed up with respect to ISNI on this one anyway. On the Long-Term Ecological Research issue, we have at least one other request on this (#197, see also #442) so that would be a separate consideration.

Anyway, marking as declined and out of scope now.

Please follow #414 for the merge and #470 for the new record request. The new record request has been approved and will be included in our next release (currently targeted for Q1 of this year). The deprecation and redirecting from old records will require development work, so unfortunately I don't have a timeline for its availability at present.

Anyway, this organization seems to be a research services provider. Once again the publication list they provide is not one, and again there's no sign of citation or acknowledgement with this name in Google Scholar, but I do find for example several dozen employees listed on LinkedIn, and they seem to have a presence in the US as well as India, possibly other locations. Should we try to insist on them providing actual published articles or datasets relating to this organization? I suppose this could be added to ROR but it seems marginal without further evidence of actual published research, outside of their own website. Really not sure what to do here.

comment_text: Adding additional context from #540 to this request: contributions to DISSCO (https://www.dissco.eu/) appear to require a ROR ID, so the department level collections are seeking them out to identify their data contributions.

comment_text: Flagged item from bulk list. Comments from Arthur: I'm not sure on this one - it's not clear it's really a research-related organization, it seems to be more a regulatory agency. However it does do something related to patents, so maybe? See this publication: https://repositorio.indecopi.gob.pe/handle/11724/4399

Some other sections are already linked to the ISNI above. Here is an overview of the organisation of the DGfE Divisions: https://www.dgfe.de/en/divisions-subdivisions

It would make sense to add a ROR entry for the DGfE first and then assess this request again.
