comment_text: Clearly they publish books (and periodicals? I couldn't see their list of periodicals though) in Russian, and provide access electronically. However, I don't see them involved in research directly, and found no sign of the use of ""IPR Books"" or ""IPR Media"" as an affiliation. I think this is not suitable for ROR at this time, at least unless we get further evidence they are used as an affiliation or are involved in research more significantly somehow. Willing to hear somebody else's opinion on this too of course!

comment_text: This is a Ukrainian organization established in 2017/2018 that organizes and publishes the proceedings for an annual conference on mental health. They also publish a peer reviewed open access journal. No affiliation use found. Organization seems to be run by one person, Dr. Viktor Vus. I don't think this organization is in scope, second reviewer may want to move to Needs Discussion. If adding, will also need to discuss metadata. Org name in the request was ""International Platform on Mental Health"", but the name throughout org's website is ""Mental Health: Global Challenges of XXI Century.""

Other information about this request: I would like to register both Brown Dog Consulting LLC (a for-profit corporation) and Lotus Circle (a nonprofit corporation).  I am the founder of both organizations and am affiliated with the University of Washington in Seattle, WA as a Senior Fellow in the Disability Inclusive Development Initiative and, effective January 2022, Affiliate Assistant Professor in the Law, Societies and Justice Department.  Both BDC and LC are vehicles to bridge the gap between academic research and its practical applications.  I use both to facilitate contracting with external organizations such as UNESCO and Humanity & Inclusion for research particularly into the rights of persons with disabilities.  We are anticipating applying for grants from organizations like SVRI and others and expanding our research profile, for which a ROR ID would be helpful.  Many thanks in advance for your consideration.","arthurpsmith

comment_text: Generally, we do not assign separate ROR IDs for libraries that are part of a university. This is a policy GRID has held as well. I will be curious to know whether the requestor's GRID ID application ends up getting approved. I would suggest that we discuss this as a group and keep an eye on the next (final) GRID update.

The new institute name is being used as an affiliation in publications, e.g., https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2020.126103.

comment_text: This is a community that hosts annual competitions for undergraduate students to create gene annotations, ran by Texas A&M. Related publications use Texas A&M affiliation.

I searched Google Scholar for  references to the full name (""Community Assessment of Community Annotation with Ontology"") and it is referenced or acknowledged in about a dozen articles, but not used as an affiliation. Searching for the abbreviation CACAO brought up entirely unrelated papers so that wasn't helpful.  Anyway, I don't see this as being in scope for ROR.

comment_text: They have a somewhat nice website and do appear to be some sort of educational organization, but they are not listed in ISNI nor wikimedia sites, nor as a Crossref Funder. Their ""link to publications"" does not list publications, only shows some certificates/awards. Searching Google Scholar for ""ProRelix"" finds nothing with this as an affiliation or anywhere else. It seems to me they are not involved in published research and do not qualify to be included in ROR.

Rather, it includes one award and one certificate that were awarded to the institution. No publications found when searching Google Scholar and Web of Science. I concur with @arthurpsmith - this institution does not appear to be involved in research and therefore does not match criteria [2] for inclusion in ROR (https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates).

The SPDF is one of a very few facilities addressed in our first proof of concept use case, so its record would need to be updated to add the additional type.  

In addition, NASA may already have alternate ID's for each of these facilities, so the ability to add those would be very helpful...  They certainly do for this facility which has the id spase://SMWG/Repository/NASA/GSFC/SPDF

comment_text: GRID created this record for the UK subsidiary, but there's no record for the US parent. I think we should create a separate ROR record for the parent organization (and link them with our parent/child relationship). The ISNI and Wikipedia page on this record should be moved to the US parent. However the Wikidata ID for the US parent is different: Q6895942.

comment_text: I agree with Arthur's assessment - this ROR ID should stay with the UK subsidiary, and we should create a new ROR record for the US parent.

I noticed this ROR ID is linked to the UK Wikidata ID - https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30290687 - but not the US one. This supports us keeping this ROR for the UK subsidiary, rather than updating it to represent the US parent.

comment_text: Not certain whether this sufficiently constitutes an independent, top-level entity. From the org's ""Publishing"" page:

""The services of Kiel University Publishing are available to all members and affiliates of Kiel University, as described in the constitution. This means that researchers from Kiel University must be involved in all publications, whether as authors or editors. Within the publication projects, they are therefore the main contact persons of the publishing team.""

I can likewise find no affiliation usage for the press itself, which corresponds with the above (authors and editors would likely identify with Kiel University instead). In addition, Kiel University is already represented in ROR (https://ror.org/04v76ef78). We only otherwise seem to have 11 entities with a ""university press"" included in their title (https://ror.org/search?page=1&query=%22university%20press%22), but happy to hear anything else on precedent.

comment_text: Note their contact page says they are ""c/o Universitätsbibliothek Kiel"" - and the about page also mentions the publishing service is provided by the library. So not only is this clearly not an independent ""top-level"" organization, there's another layer between it and the university which we don't have in ROR either (German Wikipedia has an entry for the library at least: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universitätsbibliothek_Kiel). So I'm afraid this is definitely out of ROR's current scope. If and when we support subunits of research organizations then this is a likely useful addition, but not right now.

https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XZ9Mon8AAAAJ

If they are sponsoring research, we would need additional examples. Doesn't appear to be sufficient evidence of research activity at the moment. Recommend being flagged as out of scope.

comment_text: Searching Google Scholar for this name is a little confusing because there seems to be also some sort of device called ""DevScope"" used in research, which appears to be completely unrelated. Anyway, yes the only research articles I could find with this affiliation were by the same person. I agree out of scope for now.

comment_text: Not certain whether this sufficiently constitutes a top-level entity as it is under the Center for Limnology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It's director appears to use the University of Wisconsin affiliation, (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-0lQw-wAAAAJ). Other research station entities in ROR appear to have a greater degree of independence. The North Temperate Lakes US Long-Term Ecological Research Network (https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/), which they cite as supplying data for, also appears to be under the umbrella of the University of Wisconsin.

comment_text: I agree this is not a top-level research organization. At some point we should find a way to support these, but right now out of scope for ROR.

The ISNI entry they reference is also interesting, as it has ""University of Wisconsin Madison Center for Limnology"" as one of the names - but the request lists that as a parent. So things are a bit mixed up with respect to ISNI on this one anyway. On the Long-Term Ecological Research issue, we have at least one other request on this (#197, see also #442) so that would be a separate consideration.

Anyway, marking as declined and out of scope now.

comment_text: @tyoungmarsh This request was closed as it is a duplicate request for #414. The request to merge the records itself has not been declined, just this duplicate instance of it. We allow only one issue to represent a specific request to prevent confusion and data errors. 

Please follow #414 for the merge and #470 for the new record request. The new record request has been approved and will be included in our next release (currently targeted for Q1 of this year). The deprecation and redirecting from old records will require development work, so unfortunately I don't have a timeline for its availability at present.

comment_text: Hi @adambuttrick excellent, thank you so much.  I wrongly assumed work on creating/merging a new ROR would not commence without a request from an organisation, therefore I never checked to see if any tickets were already created.  Thanks again, and looking forward to seeing our new TUS ROR.

I found multiple affiliation use cases - see http://www.roganteengineering.it/pubblicazioni.asp. I can see a case being made for adding this organization to ROR.

comment_text: I'm not sure on the relation between this and #297 - I assume the same parent organization (or is #297 the parent for this?) Anyway, this organization seems to be a research services provider. Once again the publication list they provide is not one, and again there's no sign of citation or acknowledgement with this name in Google Scholar, but I do find for example several dozen employees listed on LinkedIn, and they seem to have a presence in the US as well as India, possibly other locations. Should we try to insist on them providing actual published articles or datasets relating to this organization? I suppose this could be added to ROR but it seems marginal without further evidence of actual published research, outside of their own website. Really not sure what to do here.

I see very few similar records in ROR. The two that we do include (https://ror.org/00x6h5n95 ; https://ror.org/014trz974) are more distinctly independent entities. They would most likely use the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ID for their data deposits and other contributors could likewise use their own ROR IDs.

There does NOT seem to be an ISNI for the new agency. I think it would be confusing to re-use this ROR id for the new one. I believe we should create a new ID for this since there are so many differences, and the previous organization was not entirely folded into the new one:

comment_text: I received some additional information from the requesting organization that might help us come to a decision. The comments came from 3 different colleagues. The questions about handling deprecated/redirected IDs is something we don't have a solution for yet, but will be exploring this year. 

> In relation to your question on whether or not to update the existing record or create a new record for UKHSA please see comments below from staff here:
>  
> **Comment 1**
> I can’t see any disadvantages with a new entry for UKHSA. Obviously the PHE entry would need to indicate that PHE no longer exists. Would the PHE entry stay visible? If yes, then a suitable contact, presumably at UKHSA, should be supplied.
>  
> **Comment 2**
> Creating a new record for UKHSA should not be a disadvantage, but if a new record for UKHSA is created will it show that it was previously linked to PHE or are all the records on the ROR standalone records where no relationship/predecessor organisations are shown?
>  
> **Comment 3**
> I think the reason we were thinking to initially update/modify the existing record rather than create a new record was because we know of at least one current service that is using the ROR to identify organisations, and this is a journal checker tool: https://journalcheckertool.org/. Currently this journal checker tool is using PHE’s ROR ID, so if a new record is created for UKHSA it will mean we will have to contact this service to get them to change the organisation name/ROR ID to UKHSA. We are also unsure of any other services that are currently using PHE’s ROR ID that may need to be contacted if there is a new record created on the ROR for UKHSA. Although admittedly services currently using the PHE ROR ID might not be dynamically updating anyway, so even if the existing PHE ROR record was only updated/modified to show details of the new organisation these services may still need to be contacted to get them to manually update their information.

comment_text: Weighing in here - to me, it's significant that the website says PHE has been replaced by UKHSA **and** the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities. If we modify PHE to UKHSA, we aren't representing the change accurately - and in cases where the previous ROR ID was used as an affiliation, staff who are now part of the OHID will be mislabeled as affiliated with UKHSA.

I support creating a new ROR ID for _both_ the new organizations - UKHSA and OHID - and relating these organizations back to PHE. This does mean that services that use the PHE ROR, like the journal checker tool, will need to make changes. 

Unfortunately, I think this is part of the messiness of government departments... we have similar cases in Canada that I have noticed in ROR (both federal and provincial level), which I haven't submitted yet. Ultimately, I would be interested to see ROR add predecessor/successor relationship types, for cases that are not a straightforward name change.

comment_text: I agree with Kelly's assessment. We should create two records for the successor organizations, although we would have to determine what proper redirect for this case would be. I will flag this as an example in our development discussions, as well as the predecessor/successor relationship types as a potential change to the data model.

comment_text: Under the Horizon 2020 scheme, the ERA-NET funding program has been merged into a single instrument, with the goal of ""topping up"" funding for trans-European research across various domains. Full description of the instrument [here](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/cross-cutting-issues/era-net_en.htm). We have a precedent in ROR, inherited from GRID, of a specific ERA-NET instrument from prior to their merging into a single instrument - ERA Plant Genomics https://ror.org/055pf8065.

I've added Brussels as a location because of the scheme originating with the European Commission, but please let me know if anyone thinks another location would be more appropriate. This specific request came in from a funding recipient looking to use ROR to acknowledge their funders.

I think this item might need some extra discussion. Looking at the [Checklist for evaluating new organizations](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/wiki/Curator-Evaluation-Workflow:-New-Records#checklist-for-evaluating-new-organizations), most criteria are not met. Also the type ""funding scheme"" does not exist as a type of organization in the [Guidance for evaluating common organization types](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/wiki/Curator-Evaluation-Workflow:-New-Records#guidance-for-evaluating-common-organization-types). Technically, the ERC Research Council (https://ror.org/0472cxd90) is the organization behind the funding scheme ERA-Net Cofund.

""The main and compulsory activity of the ERA-NET Cofund under Horizon 2020 is the implementation of the co-funded joint call for proposals that leads to the funding of trans-national research and/or innovation projects (one co-funded call per Grant Agreement)."" https://www.era-learn.eu/support-for-partnerships/cofunded-p2p/era-net-cofund 

A use case, where a funder ID might be needed, is the funding reference in the DataCite metadata schema:
```
<fundingReference>
<funderName>European Commission</funderName>
<funderIdentifier funderIdentifierType=""Crossref Funder ID"">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</funderIdentifier>
<awardNumber awardURI=""https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/100603_en.html"">284382</awardNumber>
<awardTitle>
Institutionalizing global genetic-resource commons. Global Strategies for accessing and using essential public knowledge assets in the life sciences
</awardTitle>
</fundingReference>
```

However, ""ERA-Net Cofund"" cannot be found in either ISNI or Crossref Funder Registry.

And regarding the entry mentioned in the initial post, the ""Year established"" shows 9999. Is this used as a placeholder?

comment_text: Hmm, this is seems to be a new funding program, part of the Australian ""National Environmental Science Program"" (NESP), under the Australian government ""Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment"", ROR https://ror.org/030c92375. Neither NESP nor this portion of it seem to have funder ID's. However NESP does have an ISNI id: https://isni.org/isni/0000000494148945 
I don't see any sign of this recovery hub being used as an affiliation. The publications they list are from researchers at other universities in Australia, generally.

If we add something for this to ROR I think we ought to just add NESP which seems to be the higher-level funding organization and is referenced in several places on this recovery hub website. But maybe the existing Australian AWE department is enough?

comment_text: This one is tricky. I think it is used as an affiliation (for example, in https://www.publish.csiro.au/pc/Fulltext/PC19036?subscribe=false), but it is listed alongside Charles Darwin University in this publication, one of the Hub's partner universities (https://www.environment.gov.au/science/nesp/hub-threatened-species-recovery). It appears that all researchers affiliated with the Hub have another research organization as their primary appointment.

I am not sure if adding NESP addresses the issue; to me, it seems less accurate to say that these researchers are affiliated with NESP broadly, than to say they are affiliated with their specific research Hub. The six Hubs seem to function independently from each other (separate websites, etc), although each is accountable to NESP.

Another factor is that this project does not appear to be premised on long-term stability. According to this page, this Hub will not continue to exist past 2021 - it is part of Phase 1 of the NESP: http://www.environment.gov.au/science/nesp/phase-1. There are different Hubs for Phase 2: http://www.environment.gov.au/science/nesp/about.

comment_text: I removed the ""Crossref Funder ID"" as that was not a Crossref Funder ID, just a copy of the publication DOI. They appear to be a small publisher with one journal ""African Journal of Political Sciences"" from Algeria which seems to publish in Arabic? Not to be confused with ""African Journal of Political Science"" from South Africa which publishes in English and French. Their website is a mess - at least when I opened it with Chrome most of the pages were blank or almost full of advertising. The journal pages also had ads but they appear to be legitimate political science research papers. They've been around since 2012, or at least that is when the first issue of the journal came out.

So this is a scope question - are we adding small publishers like this one, or not? I'd be inclined to say no. Willing to hear a second opinion though.

Many of their webpages didn't contain content and their About page seem to have formatting errors so that it wasn't readable. The African Journal of Political Sciences is supposed to be OA, but I could access full-text to any of the articles in the publication. There was just metadata and a download button that I was a bit worried about. 

I'm not sure that it makes sense to assign a ROR at this point.

comment_text: They have an ISNI also, but nothing in Wikipedia/Wikidata.
However, I looked in Google Scholar and while there are a number of papers using this affiliation, they all appear to be from a single author - ""Jing Ming"", who is also the author with that affiliation on the publications example provided. The website (which looks like a ""blog"") provides no sign of any other people involved. So I think this does *not* qualify for a ROR id as it appears to be a single-researcher operation. Perhaps this could be revisited in future if they appear to have expanded but for now I don't think this qualifies.

comment_text: I've never heard of an anthropology  consultant  before, that's interesting! But it appears  from a search for publications  there is just one person using this affiliation -  ""Matt Artz"". There do seem  to be maybe a half-dozen papers by him with this affiliation (from Google Scholar) but I agree this isn't sufficient to justify a ROR id. Let's revisit a year or two down the road to  see if there's more info that can be found or it's clearly more than just one person.

comment_text: Similar to https://ror.org/04awze035, which they cite on their webpage. Essentially, they seem to provide an affiliation for use by researchers working outside of traditional and academic roles. Not certain how involved they are with our ""conducting,"" ""producing,"" or ""managing"" research use cases. More an example of ""touches"" research, but precedent does exist with cited Ronin Institute.

comment_text: I'm not very impressed with their website - most of the things you click on do not seem to provide any information (the FAQ, the lists of members, in particular - tried Safari and Chrome). However, it does appear to have been used as an affiliation in publications by more than one or two distinct researchers. Is it really a research organization in the sense that we define it? I guess we do have a precedent as mentioned. So while this might be a borderline case, I do think it should have a ROR id.

But I think it's a one-person project - Guendelman is the one who's been using it as an affiliation, and from Google Scholar it's on 4 or 5 papers at most.

comment_text: Publishing house related to #727 . Publishes numerous mathematical books and journals. While not entirely independent from #727, has a separate domain and is located in a different country/city from them. Could go either way on this, so I would like to see what others have to say.

I've changed the primary name to EMS Press from the original submission (which had EMS press as an alias), in accordance with their branding and copyright statement. The statement, however,  reads, ""EMS Press is an imprint of the European Mathematical Society - EMS - Publishing House GmbH, a subsidiary of the European Mathematical Society,"" so the hierarchy and names here get a little confusing,

comment_text: This is a legacy request submitted by the organization in 2020. The organization decided to hold the request until ROR had the ability to link related organizations. I am reinstating the request so that we can review it for inclusion in a future release. 

This is an independent entity that is also part of the Helmholtz Association (https://ror.org/0281dp749). It is involved in publishing research and supporting researchers. As far as I can tell, publications associated with the office tend to use the main affiliation for the Helmholtz Association, and related IDs are at the association level as well. 

We should consider whether the current representation at the association level is sufficient, or whether a new record should be created to identify the open science office.

comment_text: This is not listed as one of the 18 Hemlholtz centers - https://www.helmholtz.de/ueber-uns/helmholtz-zentren/ - rather it is mentioned under their ""values"" - https://www.helmholtz.de/ueber-uns/unsere-werte/open-science/ - I think at the least this office is not really considered independent of the central association as are the research centers. I did find one use of the office explicitly as an affiliation, but generally their staff seem to be happy to just list ""Helmholtz Association"" as the affiliation. My recommendation is not to create a new ROR id for this office, at least until/unless we are ready to add university departments etc which I would consider comparable or more justified than this.

comment_text: Not certain we should process this as a simple name change. According to Wikipedia, the company was split into two different entities in 2015:

""In August 2015, JDSU split into two different companies: [Viavi Solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viavi_Solutions) and [Lumentum Holdings](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lumentum_Holdings&action=edit&redlink=1)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDSU#cite_note-3).""

So, we should probably process this as a new record and deprecation request, as well as possible deprecating the non-US records. While they list foreign offices on their site, it's not clear to me that these still constitute independent, top-level entities. The ""Office Locations"" section of their site list a single corporate headquarters and the sales, manufacturing, and research and development facilities.

I'm not sure how you want to proceed - I guess I'll move this into ""Needs discussion"" but I don't know that we need to do much here other than deprecate at least the US entry for JDSU (and redirect to the other ID when possible).

comment_text: They are a publisher, under their subsidiary ""Maheswari Publishers"", of several (3) language/literature journals in English and Tamil. I can't find either Pandian or Maheswari used as an affiliiation. The ""CARE"" mentioned as listing one of their journals is an Indian university approval organization that approves of journals meeting a certain quality standard. I'm not sure how to confirm they are actually on this list. As a publisher perhaps this should be added? However I'd suggest adding the Maheswari Publishers name as an alias since that seems to be their primary research-related activity.

comment_text: This seems almost certainly out of scope - they are an advocacy organization, not a research organization. However, the linked (1) publication lists them as a funder, so to the extent that is a research publication perhaps they qualify as funding research? They are not listed in any of our standard reference databases that I can find (no ISNI, Crossref funder entry, no Wikipedia entries). If there's a feeling we shouldn't deny this outright perhaps we could query them for more details on why they are asking for a ROR id?

comment_text: TU Delft's university press. Publishes numerous open access books and journals, including co-publications with other universities and research institutes (e.g. [International Journal of Water Governance](https://journals.open.tudelft.nl/ijwg)). More examples [here](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/current-topics/open-publishing). While university presses normally require independent affiliation usage, the scope of their activities and editorial involvement from outside researchers puts them closer to the precedents like https://ror.org/03jsdjx34 and https://ror.org/006v7bf86.

Cambridge University Press has its own website, has been around almost 500 years, has a major presence in many areas of publishing, has thousands of employees around the world - and has a pretty substantive wikipedia page about itself. I don't think this university press is anywhere close to comparable.

comment_text: This is a well-established Spanish journal but as far as I can tell, it is not part of an overarching publishing organization, so it is not entirely within scope for ROR. An ISSN (which they already have) is a more appropriate identifier. I would suggest closing as out of scope and we can revisit later if need be.

comment_text: Hi - there seems to be a bit of confusion here.
Jagiellonian College in Toruń is in Toruń, Poland, and its website is https://kj.edu.pl/
That is the entity with Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagiellonian_College and WIkidata ID Q9360262
There is also a Polish wikipedia page for it here: https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolegium_Jagiello%C5%84skie_%E2%80%93_Toru%C5%84ska_Szko%C5%82a_Wy%C5%BCsza
It was established in 2003. We don't seem to have a ROR id for it, so that would be good to add.

However, the requested entity here is something different - it appears to be a particular faculty of this college that is located in the Czech Republic. The English website (http://www.fves.eu/en/index.html) gives it the full name of ""Faculty of Administration and Economic Studies in Uherské Hradiště Jagiellonian College in Toruń"".

The affiliation usage case that Adam found doesn't mention whether it's the Polish or Czech locations, so I'm not sure if it supports having a separate identifier for the Czech faculty. However, given previous GRID practices that created separate entities for subsidiaries in a different country I think a ROR id for the Czech entity is also justified here. But we should take some care with the metadata so that we are clearly distinguishing them.

comment_text: @arthurpsmith Good catch. I'm going to create a request for the main campus and keep this as a separate issue to discuss whether the Czech institute is in scope as a distinct entity. Since the page lists it as ""part of the Jagiellonian University in Toruń, Poland,"" there needs to be sussing out of whether any of the affiliation usage references the Czech vs Polish departments.

comment_text: I'm seeing multiple instances of affiliation usage with Catalan form (e.g. https://www.apunts.org/index.php?p=revista&tipo=pdf-simple&pii=XX88665810205897X ; https://upcommons.upc.edu/bitstream/handle/2099/728/Autors4.pdf), so I'm not sure it makes sense to remove this from the record. For the purpose of discovery and affiliation matching, I think it would be better to preserve.

comment_text: @adambuttrick There were changes from last application. 
Currently, the organization fulfill all three inclusion criteria, and is not out of scope.
It is standalone organization, publishes researches and employs researchers and used as an affiliation in published research outputs. 
Current publication provided is a peer-reviewed one in Frontiers in Psychiatry.

comment_text: @PaudelDhirendra Thank you for your feedback. Per my previous comment on #536, the rejection of Mental Health and Yoga was based on it appearing to be a one-person organization. At present, those are out of scope for ROR. If we are mistaken and there are other staff using this an affiliation, please let us know and we will reassess.

However, the ""Parent Organization"" (which may need a new record to differentiate another layer of hierarchy) as part of the Pacific West Area (Plant Gene Expression Center, USDA-ARS, Albany, CA 94710, USA.

comment_text: The current/UC Berkeley link in ROR references both the joint status/USDA funding and the record has the location as being in Albany, CA. In addition, both [UC Berkley](https://ror.org/01an7q238) and the [USDA Agricultural Research Service - Pacific West Area](https://ror.org/03rafms67) are already listed as parent organization for this record, so I'm not certain what we would need to change here. We could add an additional link for the USDA ARS site, as technically this is a repeating field, but it would seem that funding differentiation should happen at the level of the parents.

comment_text: Hi Adam - those DOI's and ORCID entries are not for Touro Dental College!
Also note we have an entry already for New York Medical College (which is also part of Touro): https://ror.org/03dkvy735
I'm not sure we have quite the right relationships on that right now. But anyway, I agree the dental college doesn't qualify as a top-level entity suitable for ROR.

They were only barely in scope by virtue of their combined work, so I don't think we should add this as a new entry. There can either be a single ROR ID for the organization or the record should be withdrawn entirely.

comment_text: Related to request for new record request #1244. These two requests together would seem to indicate that the organization is differentiating themselves between the two principals. They were only barely in scope by virtue of their combined work, so I don't think we should process this change (setting aside the fact that we don't include corporate suffixes like this in names). There can either be a single ROR ID for the organization or the record should be withdrawn entirely.

comment_text: Research institute associated with Chinese petroleum company, Daqing Oilfield of CNPC. More extensive affiliation usage exists for the parent company using the English form ""Daqing Oilfield Company"" (e.g. : https://doi.org/10.1306/08031817416; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpetgeo.2008.01.008; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2015.06.020; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.earscirev.2016.05.004; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2117.2009.00445.x; https://doi.org/10.2118/121460-pa). 

Despite solid affiliation usage, I'm having difficulty verifying that this research institute exists separately from the company itself. Would appreciate other's thoughts here, although whatever the determination, we would still likely need to create the parent record.

comment_text: While this has an independent URL, the example affiliation listings look like ""Research Centre for Open Scholarly Metadata, Department of Classical Philology and Italian Studies, University of Bologna"", which clearly suggests this is part of the University of Bologna. As does the ""About"" page on the website. I think this is not a top-level organization and so does not qualify for its own ROR id.

comment_text: May be associated with two separate organizations - OpenCitations (which we've already approved to add to ROR) and  University of Bologna within the Department of Classical Philology and Italian Studies. Used as an affiliation, but under this department at University of Bologna. Not sure if it should have separate ROR.

comment_text: Some additional comments from the original request that may shed light on the need for a new ROR ID and the center's relationship to OpenCitations:

> The reason that we need two RORs, one for OpenCitations and one for the Research Centre for Open Scholarly Metadata is as follows:

> OpenCitations is distinct from and pre-existed the Research Centre, having grown to become a valuable independent infrastructure from a small beginning as a research project in my lab.

> The Research Centre was created specifically for two purposes: (a) to provide an institutional affiliation, a legal financial centre, and a formal administrative 'home' for OpenCitations, and (b) to permit academic activities affiliated with OpenCitations, such as being the academic home for graduate students of the University of Bologna working on projects involving open citations.  The Research Centre is formally a part of the University of Bologna in a way that OpenCitations is not.

> In the medium-term future, OpenCitations may 'spin out' to become a non-profit foundation /association/Stiftung under direct governance by the wider academic community and other stakeholders, that is administratively and financially independent from the University of Bologna.  In that case, OpenCitations will continue with its stated mission of providing open bibliographic metadata and citations, and the Research Centre will continue as an integral part of the University of Bologna in its academic roles with respect to OpenCitations, and will probably by then also have expanded its activities to include other types of metadata-oriented research work, but it will no longer be administratively and financially responsible for OpenCitations.

> For these reasons of distinctiveness, it would be sensible if OpenCitations and the Research Centre for Open Scholarly Metadata were issued separate RORs from the start, rather than trying to disentangle them at some point down the line.  That was the basis of my thinking when I wrote.

comment_text: Affiliation usage in 2022 continues to be a leading affiliation for the University of Bologna:

https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2205/2205.06764.pdf

Since this is essentially a request to create a new ROR ID contingent on a hypothetical restructuring of the organizations, I'd advise we decline this request. They can resubmit in the event any of what they described in the above actually occurs.

comment_text: Biotechnology company whose primary focus is a novel Alzheimer's therapeutic. Principals are all well-credentialed with solid publication history (https://phanesbiotech.com/publications/), but do not appear to use Phanes Biotech as their primary affiliation. That being said, is clearly involved with drug development and research and we have many similar companies in ROR (e.g. https://ror.org/02eb03q95 ; https://ror.org/043f79m81).

comment_text: Hmm, I think we should wait on this one. There's a very similarly named company that appears to be larger and more well-established, ""Phanes Therapeutics"" - https://www.phanesthera.com/ (from San Diego, established 2016) - for which we do not have a ROR ID, and it seems likely if we create one for this company without creating one for the other that could lead to some confusion. I can't find any relationship between the two, and this company is not listed for example in Crunchbase or mentioned in any news reports I could find.

The publications listed on their ""publications"" page are all from 2017 or earlier as far as I could see, which predates the company formation (so it wouldn't have been used as an affiliation). I recommend we put this on hold until we see they are actually publishing or funding research with this affiliation.

comment_text: Based on the History section of their website (https://franu.edu/about/history), it looks like this organization's previous incarnation was Our Lady of the Lake College, which does have an entry in ROR already: https://ror.org/05nx3r660. The renaming looks like it happened in 2016. So I think we just need to update the name metadata and URL in the existing record?

comment_text: I'm not certain that GRIIDC constitutes a top-level entity in ROR's sense of the term. They appear to be a data project arising from the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M University – Corpus Christi, as well as part of a now defunct ([by their own description](https://gulfresearchinitiative.org/)) ten-year program called the, ""Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative."" They do [publish datasets](https://data.gulfresearchinitiative.org/dataset-landing), but I'm not sure who would actually be considered the publisher in this case. @KellyStathis Any similar cases at DataCite that might help clarify here?

comment_text: @cmf2022 Can you tell us which publication is requiring a ROR ID? We strongly recommend against this practice, and we have also found that many authors have the mistaken impression that a ROR ID is required by a publication when it is not. Try contacting someone at the journal or publishing organization if you're unsure.

If you respond via their platform and indicate that a ROR ID is not needed, the submission will proceed normally. We're working with Hindawi to update this messaging so that this is more clear. Apologies for the confusion. ROR is not able to add organizations where research outputs are associated with a only one person.

comment_text: German research center for railway and traffic engineering and joint project between CRRC Qingdao Sifang and the University of Stuttgart. The publication provided is the only instance of affiliation usage I can find, despite the organization existing for 7 years. I'm likewise not certain that this constitutes a top-level entity. The hierarchy here appears to be University of Stuttgart -> Institute of Railway and Transportation Engineering -> CDFEB.

The hierarchy here is University of Wisconsin-Green Bay > Sheboygan campus, so we would probably need to render as such, but there does not appear to be official usage of this form. Whether University of Wisconsin-Green Bay as an entity is separate from or comprised by the individual campuses is also ambiguous.

comment_text: I agree that we should not restore this withdrawn record. This is a different type of campus situation than, e.g., campuses of the University of California. 

University of Wisconsin-Green Bay is the overarching entity and one of the four ""campuses"" (locations) comprising the university. Faculty and staff associated with the Sheboygan location do not have separate email addresses or titles specific to Sheboygan, as seen here: https://www.uwgb.edu/directory/sheboygan/. Given that we do not create records for multiple locations associated with a university (e.g., the Mission Bay campus of UCSF), I agree it is fine to keep the record withdrawn and recommend that the primary ID https://ror.org/05hbexn54 be used to reference the affiliation.

comment_text: I believe this is related to #1973 and concerns the record for Hospital Sabadell (https://ror.org/02v39xy13). I recommend that we deactivate the record for Hospital Sabadell (https://ror.org/02v39xy13). Based on my investigation, it does seem as though this would be considered a subsidiary unit and therefore out of scope. I am also not seeing evidence of affiliation usage at this level. 

There is another related unit in ROR (https://ror.org/038c0gc18) but it appears to be more independent (separate website) and I am seeing affiliation usage for it so I do not recommend deactivation of this record.

comment_text: Agreed that they are distinct - the research institute acknowledges the foundation as a parent along with CERCA, and the foundation lists the research institute prominently as a project (joint with CERCA), so I think instead of merging we should add a relationship between these two - https://ror.org/03e1n9x27 as parent of https://ror.org/00btzwk36 - make sense?

comment_text: Based on what I can determine from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Southern_Power_Grid), this is a subsidiary of China Southern Power Grid, which is already represented in ROR (https://ror.org/03hkh9419). It does not look like the other subsidiaries have separate ROR records. Most of the affiliation usage referenced above does seem to reflect China Southern Power Grid as the parent entity, e.g., in [10.1109/ISGT-Asia.2018.8467790](https://doi.org/10.1109/ISGT-Asia.2018.8467790). 

I think if we're going to create a new record for Guangzhou Power Supply Company, we should consider creating records for all of the related subsidiaries. For now, I think my recommendation would be to use the ROR ID for the parent entity.

I'll close the request for now but we can re-open and reconsider as needed.

Affiliation usage is solid, but similar case to https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/issues/1933, where the research institute is not discreet from its university parent. That being said, appears to also function in a quasi-state capacity on nuclear research and security, so this may be okay to add.

comment_text: Hmm, it seems to be *usually* stated as part of the university, but occasionally in the affiliation listings the university is not listed. The Soviet Union created a lot of institutes like this but generally they were established as part of an academy of sciences, and I'm not seeing that association in this case (which I would consider automatically making it eligible for ROR).

One place that I would look to whether this is considered an independent institution is INSPIRE-HEP - it is listed separately there: https://inspirehep.net/institutions/906240 - whereas there does NOT seem to be an independent listing there for the ""Gleb Wataghin"" institute in Brazil - it's included under Campinas State U - https://inspirehep.net/institutions/902714. But I wouldn't consider that a definitive rule, the INSPIRE-HEP listings are a bit idiosyncratic and may have some historical bias.

All that said, I'm slightly more inclined to add this to ROR than the Brazilian one, but I think it would be fine to consider both to simply be subsidiaries of their universities and not eligible.

comment_text: Per curation team discussion, we would not create separate records for these organizations. We can create inactive records for their deprecated predecessors if needed, but otherwise should leave as is and consider supporting in the context of multiple addresses.

comment_text: Hmm, I thought we'd handled these sort of university institutes generally as part of the university and not eligible for ROR. The curation policy document says ""Add to ROR if: publishing & using that affiliation, have separate funding source(s), dedicated staff, and have standalone (separate from university) website and branding."" 
Yes, they have a good history of publishing and using that affiliation (but always along with UNICAMP). I don't see separate funding sources, and their staff all appear to be at the university, not associated with the institute independent of the university. The website domain is under unicamp.br and UNICAMP is mentioned on their web pages. Adding this might be a good idea, but I think adding it also opens up a lot of similar entities that we might not want to tackle...

Research outputs identified by the main entry would be joint ventures such as research projects undertaken by faculty members of both campuses, where as the default would be to use the primary campus affiliation.

comment_text: [same comment posted on #1969] I'm not sure that we should generate distinct records for the individual campuses, as it seems the main parent institution name ""Levinsky-Wingate Academic Center"" should be considered to be the top-level affiliation, and is reflect as such in publications, e.g., https://doi.org/10.55860/YTTN7101 and https://doi.org/10.1108/978-1-80382-229-720221005.

comment_text: Exists as one of [three distinct medical campuses ](https://www.kumc.edu/school-of-medicine.html) from the University of Kansas. Would generally think this to be out of scope, but there is a case to be made that affiliation would likely be with the medical campus entities vs the university itself. Affiliation usage seems to bear this out.

comment_text: I think this is something we'll need to discuss as a group given the policy implications it represents, so I'm flagging it for discussion. 

If we did proceed with the request, I would recommend we only create one record for the medical school, not one for each campus. Campus-specific details should not be part of the affiliation (even if we do see some extant affiliation usage to this effect). However, I'm not sure that we should proceed with creating a record for the medical school, given that our current policy is to typically roll these up to the parent university.

comment_text: While there is affiliation usage using this form, I'm having a hard time discerning whether this is a college of https://ror.org/02bzfxf13 or a distinct organization. Website, link to publications, and Amharic name in the request contained junk data in the original form of the request. I can find no other website for the organization. [Secondary references](https://iphce.org/acadp_listings/debre-tabor-university-college-of-medicine-and-health-science/) also seem to suggest this is a department. Recommend declining unless concrete evidence of this as distinct organization can be demonstrated.

comment_text: There is no distinction in branding, and I couldn't find any separate funding sources.   The college of health science is listed among several other colleges (natural science, business and economics, etc.).  They make a distinction between colleges, schools, and departments, but those all seem like subdivisions, not distinct institutions.  I think it is out of scope, and declining is appropriate, unless some other evidence is forthcoming.

That being said, [Wikipedia page](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hans/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E4%BA%BA%E6%B0%91%E8%A7%A3%E6%94%BE%E5%86%9B%E8%81%94%E5%8B%A4%E4%BF%9D%E9%9A%9C%E9%83%A8%E9%98%9F%E7%AC%AC%E4%B9%9D%E5%9B%9B%E3%80%87%E5%8C%BB%E9%99%A2) for 940th hospital references this form as a former name, which leads me to believe they are the same or in some way related.

comment_text: It looks to me like they are the same thing also, at least based on the Chinese Wikipedia page which echoes much of what's on the ""Hospital overview"" page here: http://www.ljgxb.com/yygk/ - I think without further evidence we should treat this as one that's already in ROR but add a new or alternate name. But maybe we can contact the person making the original request and see if they have any more info?

That being said, were we to add these, they would be as child entities vs splitting this record. I will email requestor to clarify.
