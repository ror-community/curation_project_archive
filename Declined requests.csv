comment_text: Clearly they publish books (and periodicals? I couldn't see their list of periodicals though) in Russian, and provide access electronically. However, I don't see them involved in research directly, and found no sign of the use of ""IPR Books"" or ""IPR Media"" as an affiliation. I think this is not suitable for ROR at this time, at least unless we get further evidence they are used as an affiliation or are involved in research more significantly somehow. Willing to hear somebody else's opinion on this too of course!

comment_text: This is a Ukrainian organization established in 2017/2018 that organizes and publishes the proceedings for an annual conference on mental health. They also publish a peer reviewed open access journal. No affiliation use found. Organization seems to be run by one person, Dr. Viktor Vus. I don't think this organization is in scope, second reviewer may want to move to Needs Discussion. If adding, will also need to discuss metadata. Org name in the request was ""International Platform on Mental Health"", but the name throughout org's website is ""Mental Health: Global Challenges of XXI Century.""

Other information about this request: I would like to register both Brown Dog Consulting LLC (a for-profit corporation) and Lotus Circle (a nonprofit corporation).  I am the founder of both organizations and am affiliated with the University of Washington in Seattle, WA as a Senior Fellow in the Disability Inclusive Development Initiative and, effective January 2022, Affiliate Assistant Professor in the Law, Societies and Justice Department.  Both BDC and LC are vehicles to bridge the gap between academic research and its practical applications.  I use both to facilitate contracting with external organizations such as UNESCO and Humanity & Inclusion for research particularly into the rights of persons with disabilities.  We are anticipating applying for grants from organizations like SVRI and others and expanding our research profile, for which a ROR ID would be helpful.  Many thanks in advance for your consideration.","arthurpsmith

comment_text: Generally, we do not assign separate ROR IDs for libraries that are part of a university. This is a policy GRID has held as well. I will be curious to know whether the requestor's GRID ID application ends up getting approved. I would suggest that we discuss this as a group and keep an eye on the next (final) GRID update.

The new institute name is being used as an affiliation in publications, e.g., https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2020.126103.

comment_text: This is a community that hosts annual competitions for undergraduate students to create gene annotations, ran by Texas A&M. Related publications use Texas A&M affiliation.

I searched Google Scholar for  references to the full name (""Community Assessment of Community Annotation with Ontology"") and it is referenced or acknowledged in about a dozen articles, but not used as an affiliation. Searching for the abbreviation CACAO brought up entirely unrelated papers so that wasn't helpful.  Anyway, I don't see this as being in scope for ROR.

comment_text: They have a somewhat nice website and do appear to be some sort of educational organization, but they are not listed in ISNI nor wikimedia sites, nor as a Crossref Funder. Their ""link to publications"" does not list publications, only shows some certificates/awards. Searching Google Scholar for ""ProRelix"" finds nothing with this as an affiliation or anywhere else. It seems to me they are not involved in published research and do not qualify to be included in ROR.

Rather, it includes one award and one certificate that were awarded to the institution. No publications found when searching Google Scholar and Web of Science. I concur with @arthurpsmith - this institution does not appear to be involved in research and therefore does not match criteria [2] for inclusion in ROR (https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates).

The SPDF is one of a very few facilities addressed in our first proof of concept use case, so its record would need to be updated to add the additional type.  

In addition, NASA may already have alternate ID's for each of these facilities, so the ability to add those would be very helpful...  They certainly do for this facility which has the id spase://SMWG/Repository/NASA/GSFC/SPDF

comment_text: GRID created this record for the UK subsidiary, but there's no record for the US parent. I think we should create a separate ROR record for the parent organization (and link them with our parent/child relationship). The ISNI and Wikipedia page on this record should be moved to the US parent. However the Wikidata ID for the US parent is different: Q6895942.

comment_text: I agree with Arthur's assessment - this ROR ID should stay with the UK subsidiary, and we should create a new ROR record for the US parent.

I noticed this ROR ID is linked to the UK Wikidata ID - https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q30290687 - but not the US one. This supports us keeping this ROR for the UK subsidiary, rather than updating it to represent the US parent.

comment_text: Not certain whether this sufficiently constitutes an independent, top-level entity. From the org's ""Publishing"" page:

""The services of Kiel University Publishing are available to all members and affiliates of Kiel University, as described in the constitution. This means that researchers from Kiel University must be involved in all publications, whether as authors or editors. Within the publication projects, they are therefore the main contact persons of the publishing team.""

I can likewise find no affiliation usage for the press itself, which corresponds with the above (authors and editors would likely identify with Kiel University instead). In addition, Kiel University is already represented in ROR (https://ror.org/04v76ef78). We only otherwise seem to have 11 entities with a ""university press"" included in their title (https://ror.org/search?page=1&query=%22university%20press%22), but happy to hear anything else on precedent.

comment_text: Note their contact page says they are ""c/o Universitätsbibliothek Kiel"" - and the about page also mentions the publishing service is provided by the library. So not only is this clearly not an independent ""top-level"" organization, there's another layer between it and the university which we don't have in ROR either (German Wikipedia has an entry for the library at least: https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universitätsbibliothek_Kiel). So I'm afraid this is definitely out of ROR's current scope. If and when we support subunits of research organizations then this is a likely useful addition, but not right now.

https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XZ9Mon8AAAAJ

If they are sponsoring research, we would need additional examples. Doesn't appear to be sufficient evidence of research activity at the moment. Recommend being flagged as out of scope.

comment_text: Searching Google Scholar for this name is a little confusing because there seems to be also some sort of device called ""DevScope"" used in research, which appears to be completely unrelated. Anyway, yes the only research articles I could find with this affiliation were by the same person. I agree out of scope for now.

comment_text: Not certain whether this sufficiently constitutes a top-level entity as it is under the Center for Limnology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. It's director appears to use the University of Wisconsin affiliation, (https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=-0lQw-wAAAAJ). Other research station entities in ROR appear to have a greater degree of independence. The North Temperate Lakes US Long-Term Ecological Research Network (https://lter.limnology.wisc.edu/), which they cite as supplying data for, also appears to be under the umbrella of the University of Wisconsin.

comment_text: I agree this is not a top-level research organization. At some point we should find a way to support these, but right now out of scope for ROR.

The ISNI entry they reference is also interesting, as it has ""University of Wisconsin Madison Center for Limnology"" as one of the names - but the request lists that as a parent. So things are a bit mixed up with respect to ISNI on this one anyway. On the Long-Term Ecological Research issue, we have at least one other request on this (#197, see also #442) so that would be a separate consideration.

Anyway, marking as declined and out of scope now.

comment_text: @tyoungmarsh This request was closed as it is a duplicate request for #414. The request to merge the records itself has not been declined, just this duplicate instance of it. We allow only one issue to represent a specific request to prevent confusion and data errors. 

Please follow #414 for the merge and #470 for the new record request. The new record request has been approved and will be included in our next release (currently targeted for Q1 of this year). The deprecation and redirecting from old records will require development work, so unfortunately I don't have a timeline for its availability at present.

I wrongly assumed work on creating/merging a new ROR would not commence without a request from an organisation, therefore I never checked to see if any tickets were already created.  Thanks again, and looking forward to seeing our new TUS ROR.

I found multiple affiliation use cases - see http://www.roganteengineering.it/pubblicazioni.asp. I can see a case being made for adding this organization to ROR.

comment_text: I'm not sure on the relation between this and #297 - I assume the same parent organization (or is #297 the parent for this?) Anyway, this organization seems to be a research services provider. Once again the publication list they provide is not one, and again there's no sign of citation or acknowledgement with this name in Google Scholar, but I do find for example several dozen employees listed on LinkedIn, and they seem to have a presence in the US as well as India, possibly other locations. Should we try to insist on them providing actual published articles or datasets relating to this organization? I suppose this could be added to ROR but it seems marginal without further evidence of actual published research, outside of their own website. Really not sure what to do here.

I see very few similar records in ROR. The two that we do include (https://ror.org/00x6h5n95 ; https://ror.org/014trz974) are more distinctly independent entities. They would most likely use the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ID for their data deposits and other contributors could likewise use their own ROR IDs.

There does NOT seem to be an ISNI for the new agency. I think it would be confusing to re-use this ROR id for the new one. I believe we should create a new ID for this since there are so many differences, and the previous organization was not entirely folded into the new one:

comment_text: I received some additional information from the requesting organization that might help us come to a decision. The comments came from 3 different colleagues. The questions about handling deprecated/redirected IDs is something we don't have a solution for yet, but will be exploring this year. 

> In relation to your question on whether or not to update the existing record or create a new record for UKHSA please see comments below from staff here:
>  
> **Comment 1**
> I can’t see any disadvantages with a new entry for UKHSA. Obviously the PHE entry would need to indicate that PHE no longer exists. Would the PHE entry stay visible? If yes, then a suitable contact, presumably at UKHSA, should be supplied.
>  
> **Comment 2**
> Creating a new record for UKHSA should not be a disadvantage, but if a new record for UKHSA is created will it show that it was previously linked to PHE or are all the records on the ROR standalone records where no relationship/predecessor organisations are shown?
>  
> **Comment 3**
> I think the reason we were thinking to initially update/modify the existing record rather than create a new record was because we know of at least one current service that is using the ROR to identify organisations, and this is a journal checker tool: https://journalcheckertool.org/. Currently this journal checker tool is using PHE’s ROR ID, so if a new record is created for UKHSA it will mean we will have to contact this service to get them to change the organisation name/ROR ID to UKHSA. We are also unsure of any other services that are currently using PHE’s ROR ID that may need to be contacted if there is a new record created on the ROR for UKHSA. Although admittedly services currently using the PHE ROR ID might not be dynamically updating anyway, so even if the existing PHE ROR record was only updated/modified to show details of the new organisation these services may still need to be contacted to get them to manually update their information.

comment_text: Weighing in here - to me, it's significant that the website says PHE has been replaced by UKHSA **and** the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities. If we modify PHE to UKHSA, we aren't representing the change accurately - and in cases where the previous ROR ID was used as an affiliation, staff who are now part of the OHID will be mislabeled as affiliated with UKHSA.

I support creating a new ROR ID for _both_ the new organizations - UKHSA and OHID - and relating these organizations back to PHE. This does mean that services that use the PHE ROR, like the journal checker tool, will need to make changes. 

Unfortunately, I think this is part of the messiness of government departments... we have similar cases in Canada that I have noticed in ROR (both federal and provincial level), which I haven't submitted yet. Ultimately, I would be interested to see ROR add predecessor/successor relationship types, for cases that are not a straightforward name change.

comment_text: I agree with Kelly's assessment. We should create two records for the successor organizations, although we would have to determine what proper redirect for this case would be. I will flag this as an example in our development discussions, as well as the predecessor/successor relationship types as a potential change to the data model.

comment_text: Under the Horizon 2020 scheme, the ERA-NET funding program has been merged into a single instrument, with the goal of ""topping up"" funding for trans-European research across various domains. Full description of the instrument [here](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/cross-cutting-issues/era-net_en.htm). We have a precedent in ROR, inherited from GRID, of a specific ERA-NET instrument from prior to their merging into a single instrument - ERA Plant Genomics https://ror.org/055pf8065.

I've added Brussels as a location because of the scheme originating with the European Commission, but please let me know if anyone thinks another location would be more appropriate. This specific request came in from a funding recipient looking to use ROR to acknowledge their funders.

I think this item might need some extra discussion. Looking at the [Checklist for evaluating new organizations](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/wiki/Curator-Evaluation-Workflow:-New-Records#checklist-for-evaluating-new-organizations), most criteria are not met. Also the type ""funding scheme"" does not exist as a type of organization in the [Guidance for evaluating common organization types](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/wiki/Curator-Evaluation-Workflow:-New-Records#guidance-for-evaluating-common-organization-types). Technically, the ERC Research Council (https://ror.org/0472cxd90) is the organization behind the funding scheme ERA-Net Cofund.

""The main and compulsory activity of the ERA-NET Cofund under Horizon 2020 is the implementation of the co-funded joint call for proposals that leads to the funding of trans-national research and/or innovation projects (one co-funded call per Grant Agreement)."" https://www.era-learn.eu/support-for-partnerships/cofunded-p2p/era-net-cofund 

A use case, where a funder ID might be needed, is the funding reference in the DataCite metadata schema:
```
<fundingReference>
<funderName>European Commission</funderName>
<funderIdentifier funderIdentifierType=""Crossref Funder ID"">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</funderIdentifier>
<awardNumber awardURI=""https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/100603_en.html"">284382</awardNumber>
<awardTitle>
Institutionalizing global genetic-resource commons. Global Strategies for accessing and using essential public knowledge assets in the life sciences
</awardTitle>
</fundingReference>
```

However, ""ERA-Net Cofund"" cannot be found in either ISNI or Crossref Funder Registry.

And regarding the entry mentioned in the initial post, the ""Year established"" shows 9999. Is this used as a placeholder?

comment_text: Hmm, this is seems to be a new funding program, part of the Australian ""National Environmental Science Program"" (NESP), under the Australian government ""Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment"", ROR https://ror.org/030c92375. Neither NESP nor this portion of it seem to have funder ID's. However NESP does have an ISNI id: https://isni.org/isni/0000000494148945 
I don't see any sign of this recovery hub being used as an affiliation. The publications they list are from researchers at other universities in Australia, generally.

If we add something for this to ROR I think we ought to just add NESP which seems to be the higher-level funding organization and is referenced in several places on this recovery hub website. But maybe the existing Australian AWE department is enough?

comment_text: This one is tricky. I think it is used as an affiliation (for example, in https://www.publish.csiro.au/pc/Fulltext/PC19036?subscribe=false), but it is listed alongside Charles Darwin University in this publication, one of the Hub's partner universities (https://www.environment.gov.au/science/nesp/hub-threatened-species-recovery). It appears that all researchers affiliated with the Hub have another research organization as their primary appointment.

I am not sure if adding NESP addresses the issue; to me, it seems less accurate to say that these researchers are affiliated with NESP broadly, than to say they are affiliated with their specific research Hub. The six Hubs seem to function independently from each other (separate websites, etc), although each is accountable to NESP.

Another factor is that this project does not appear to be premised on long-term stability. According to this page, this Hub will not continue to exist past 2021 - it is part of Phase 1 of the NESP: http://www.environment.gov.au/science/nesp/phase-1. There are different Hubs for Phase 2: http://www.environment.gov.au/science/nesp/about.

comment_text: I removed the ""Crossref Funder ID"" as that was not a Crossref Funder ID, just a copy of the publication DOI. They appear to be a small publisher with one journal ""African Journal of Political Sciences"" from Algeria which seems to publish in Arabic? Not to be confused with ""African Journal of Political Science"" from South Africa which publishes in English and French. Their website is a mess - at least when I opened it with Chrome most of the pages were blank or almost full of advertising. The journal pages also had ads but they appear to be legitimate political science research papers. They've been around since 2012, or at least that is when the first issue of the journal came out.

So this is a scope question - are we adding small publishers like this one, or not? I'd be inclined to say no. Willing to hear a second opinion though.

comment_text: I couldn't find a link from the ajps website (https://www.ajpsdz.org/) to publications (https://doi.org/10.35788/ajps). Many of their webpages didn't contain content and their About page seem to have formatting errors so that it wasn't readable. The African Journal of Political Sciences is supposed to be OA, but I could access full-text to any of the articles in the publication. There was just metadata and a download button that I was a bit worried about. 

I'm not sure that it makes sense to assign a ROR at this point.

comment_text: They have an ISNI also, but nothing in Wikipedia/Wikidata.
However, I looked in Google Scholar and while there are a number of papers using this affiliation, they all appear to be from a single author - ""Jing Ming"", who is also the author with that affiliation on the publications example provided. The website (which looks like a ""blog"") provides no sign of any other people involved. So I think this does *not* qualify for a ROR id as it appears to be a single-researcher operation. Perhaps this could be revisited in future if they appear to have expanded but for now I don't think this qualifies.

comment_text: I've never heard of an anthropology  consultant  before, that's interesting! But it appears  from a search for publications  there is just one person using this affiliation -  ""Matt Artz"". There do seem  to be maybe a half-dozen papers by him with this affiliation (from Google Scholar) but I agree this isn't sufficient to justify a ROR id. Let's revisit a year or two down the road to  see if there's more info that can be found or it's clearly more than just one person.

comment_text: Similar to https://ror.org/04awze035, which they cite on their webpage. Essentially, they seem to provide an affiliation for use by researchers working outside of traditional and academic roles. Not certain how involved they are with our ""conducting,"" ""producing,"" or ""managing"" research use cases. More an example of ""touches"" research, but precedent does exist with cited Ronin Institute.

comment_text: I'm not very impressed with their website - most of the things you click on do not seem to provide any information (the FAQ, the lists of members, in particular - tried Safari and Chrome). However, it does appear to have been used as an affiliation in publications by more than one or two distinct researchers. Is it really a research organization in the sense that we define it? I guess we do have a precedent as mentioned. So while this might be a borderline case, I do think it should have a ROR id.

But I think it's a one-person project - Guendelman is the one who's been using it as an affiliation, and from Google Scholar it's on 4 or 5 papers at most. If it really does create an institute as proposed then we can add to ROR then; we can move it to ""on hold"" for now, but I think it's likely to remain out of scope for at least a few more years.

comment_text: Publishing house related to #727 . Publishes numerous mathematical books and journals. While not entirely independent from #727, has a separate domain and is located in a different country/city from them. Could go either way on this, so I would like to see what others have to say.

I've changed the primary name to EMS Press from the original submission (which had EMS press as an alias), in accordance with their branding and copyright statement. The statement, however,  reads, ""EMS Press is an imprint of the European Mathematical Society - EMS - Publishing House GmbH, a subsidiary of the European Mathematical Society,"" so the hierarchy and names here get a little confusing,

comment_text: This is a legacy request submitted by the organization in 2020. The organization decided to hold the request until ROR had the ability to link related organizations. I am reinstating the request so that we can review it for inclusion in a future release. 

This is an independent entity that is also part of the Helmholtz Association (https://ror.org/0281dp749). It is involved in publishing research and supporting researchers. As far as I can tell, publications associated with the office tend to use the main affiliation for the Helmholtz Association, and related IDs are at the association level as well. 

We should consider whether the current representation at the association level is sufficient, or whether a new record should be created to identify the open science office.

comment_text: This is not listed as one of the 18 Hemlholtz centers - https://www.helmholtz.de/ueber-uns/helmholtz-zentren/ - rather it is mentioned under their ""values"" - https://www.helmholtz.de/ueber-uns/unsere-werte/open-science/ - I think at the least this office is not really considered independent of the central association as are the research centers. I did find one use of the office explicitly as an affiliation, but generally their staff seem to be happy to just list ""Helmholtz Association"" as the affiliation. My recommendation is not to create a new ROR id for this office, at least until/unless we are ready to add university departments etc which I would consider comparable or more justified than this.

comment_text: Not certain we should process this as a simple name change. According to Wikipedia, the company was split into two different entities in 2015:

""In August 2015, JDSU split into two different companies: [Viavi Solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viavi_Solutions) and [Lumentum Holdings](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lumentum_Holdings&action=edit&redlink=1)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDSU#cite_note-3).""

So, we should probably process this as a new record and deprecation request, as well as possible deprecating the non-US records. While they list foreign offices on their site, it's not clear to me that these still constitute independent, top-level entities. The ""Office Locations"" section of their site list a single corporate headquarters and the sales, manufacturing, and research and development facilities.

I'm not sure how you want to proceed - I guess I'll move this into ""Needs discussion"" but I don't know that we need to do much here other than deprecate at least the US entry for JDSU (and redirect to the other ID when possible).

comment_text: They are a publisher, under their subsidiary ""Maheswari Publishers"", of several (3) language/literature journals in English and Tamil. I can't find either Pandian or Maheswari used as an affiliiation. The ""CARE"" mentioned as listing one of their journals is an Indian university approval organization that approves of journals meeting a certain quality standard. I'm not sure how to confirm they are actually on this list. As a publisher perhaps this should be added? However I'd suggest adding the Maheswari Publishers name as an alias since that seems to be their primary research-related activity.

comment_text: This seems almost certainly out of scope - they are an advocacy organization, not a research organization. However, the linked (1) publication lists them as a funder, so to the extent that is a research publication perhaps they qualify as funding research? They are not listed in any of our standard reference databases that I can find (no ISNI, Crossref funder entry, no Wikipedia entries). If there's a feeling we shouldn't deny this outright perhaps we could query them for more details on why they are asking for a ROR id?

comment_text: TU Delft's university press. Publishes numerous open access books and journals, including co-publications with other universities and research institutes (e.g. [International Journal of Water Governance](https://journals.open.tudelft.nl/ijwg)). More examples [here](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/library/current-topics/open-publishing). While university presses normally require independent affiliation usage, the scope of their activities and editorial involvement from outside researchers puts them closer to the precedents like https://ror.org/03jsdjx34 and https://ror.org/006v7bf86.

comment_text: It seems to me this is too closely tied to TU Delft to qualify for a separate ROR id. Cambridge University Press has its own website, has been around almost 500 years, has a major presence in many areas of publishing, has thousands of employees around the world - and has a pretty substantive wikipedia page about itself. I don't think this university press is anywhere close to comparable.

comment_text: This is a well-established Spanish journal but as far as I can tell, it is not part of an overarching publishing organization, so it is not entirely within scope for ROR. An ISSN (which they already have) is a more appropriate identifier. I would suggest closing as out of scope and we can revisit later if need be.

comment_text: Hi - there seems to be a bit of confusion here.
Jagiellonian College in Toruń is in Toruń, Poland, and its website is https://kj.edu.pl/
That is the entity with Wikipedia page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jagiellonian_College and WIkidata ID Q9360262
There is also a Polish wikipedia page for it here: https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolegium_Jagiello%C5%84skie_%E2%80%93_Toru%C5%84ska_Szko%C5%82a_Wy%C5%BCsza
It was established in 2003. We don't seem to have a ROR id for it, so that would be good to add.

However, the requested entity here is something different - it appears to be a particular faculty of this college that is located in the Czech Republic. The English website (http://www.fves.eu/en/index.html) gives it the full name of ""Faculty of Administration and Economic Studies in Uherské Hradiště Jagiellonian College in Toruń"".

The affiliation usage case that Adam found doesn't mention whether it's the Polish or Czech locations, so I'm not sure if it supports having a separate identifier for the Czech faculty. However, given previous GRID practices that created separate entities for subsidiaries in a different country I think a ROR id for the Czech entity is also justified here. But we should take some care with the metadata so that we are clearly distinguishing them.

comment_text: @arthurpsmith Good catch. I'm going to create a request for the main campus and keep this as a separate issue to discuss whether the Czech institute is in scope as a distinct entity. Since the page lists it as ""part of the Jagiellonian University in Toruń, Poland,"" there needs to be sussing out of whether any of the affiliation usage references the Czech vs Polish departments.

comment_text: I'm seeing multiple instances of affiliation usage with Catalan form (e.g. https://www.apunts.org/index.php?p=revista&tipo=pdf-simple&pii=XX88665810205897X ; https://upcommons.upc.edu/bitstream/handle/2099/728/Autors4.pdf), so I'm not sure it makes sense to remove this from the record. For the purpose of discovery and affiliation matching, I think it would be better to preserve.

comment_text: Confusing hierarchy, similar to #928. Affiliation usage has this pretty far nested within other organizations (e.g. [""Metabolic Research Laboratories and MRC Metabolic Diseases Unit, Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, Addenbrooke's Hospital, University of Cambridge""](https://doi.org/10.1002/cphy.c170047)), which leans toward it being out of scope. The parent organization, [Wellcome-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science](https://www.ims.cam.ac.uk/) may be the better ""intermediate"" organization here, as it shares the qualities of being a joint venture between the Medical Research Council and University of Cambridge.

Publication affiliation usage: https://doi.org/10.1002/cphy.c170047; https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/phy2.156 ; https://anatomypubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ar.24601

comment_text: I added the ISNI in the metadata above.

However, I agree this one seems to be part of at least two larger organizations that are more clearly ""top-level"". Just looking at the website we have:

http://www.ims.cam.ac.uk/ - Wellcome/MRC Institute of Metabolic Science - https://ror.org/0264dxb48
https://www.mrl.ims.cam.ac.uk/ - Metabolic Research Laboratories (not in ROR)

and then this seems to be a part of the second. So I think this is already covered by https://ror.org/0264dxb48 - perhaps this and ""Metabolic Research Laboratories"" should be listed as alternate names on that record? Anyway I think we are agreed this one actually does seem out of scope for ROR right now.
