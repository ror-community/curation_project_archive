comment_text: Public water company in charge of water management and related services in the Pays d'Aubagne et de l'Étoile territory of France. Provides datasets and produces reports on the related to the resources under their charge (e.g., https://doi.org/10.48799). I can't find them yet on Datacite, so I believe the request for a ROR ID may be part of their move to the platform.

Not certain whether to use the form provided for the primary name. Mailing address on their site simply list ""L’eau des collines."" I believe SPL is an abbreviation for ""Société publique locale du pays d'Aubagne et de l'Etoile.""

I found multiple affiliation use cases - see http://www.roganteengineering.it/pubblicazioni.asp. I can see a case being made for adding this organization to ROR.

I see very few similar records in ROR. The two that we do include (https://ror.org/00x6h5n95 ; https://ror.org/014trz974) are more distinctly independent entities. They would most likely use the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory ID for their data deposits and other contributors could likewise use their own ROR IDs.

comment_text: Not certain we should process this as a simple name change. According to Wikipedia, the company was split into two different entities in 2015:

""In August 2015, JDSU split into two different companies: [Viavi Solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viavi_Solutions) and [Lumentum Holdings](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lumentum_Holdings&action=edit&redlink=1)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDSU#cite_note-3).""

So, we should probably process this as a new record and deprecation request, as well as possible deprecating the non-US records. While they list foreign offices on their site, it's not clear to me that these still constitute independent, top-level entities. The ""Office Locations"" section of their site list a single corporate headquarters and the sales, manufacturing, and research and development facilities.

comment_text: Geoscience research institute in Albania. Publishes monthly seismological and climate-related datasets (https://www.geo.edu.al/newweb/?fq=sizmobuletinet&gj=gj2&kid=36 ; . While technically operating under the Polytechnic University of Tirana, is used as an independent affiliation in peer-reviewed journals (e.g. https://www.geo.edu.al/skedaret/Handy_etal_19_Tectonics.pdf) and as a leading affiliation (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kujtim-Onuzi). Believe this should be added to ROR.

comment_text: Data hosting service, similar to ROR parent Datacite and referred by them, created as a joint effort between Chile's Ministry of Science, Technology, Knowledge and Innovation (need to create record for ROR), Ministry of Economy, and Universidad Adolfo Ibáñez. Hosts state-level COVID-19 datasets, earth and marine satellite data monitoring data, and astronomical research classifiers. Should be added to ROR.

comment_text: Biotechnology company whose primary focus is a novel Alzheimer's therapeutic. Principals are all well-credentialed with solid publication history (https://phanesbiotech.com/publications/), but do not appear to use Phanes Biotech as their primary affiliation. That being said, is clearly involved with drug development and research and we have many similar companies in ROR (e.g. https://ror.org/02eb03q95 ; https://ror.org/043f79m81).

comment_text: This should not be processed as a split, but a request to add four new children for Italy's National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development. Assuming approval, I'll create separate record requests for each of these.

As to their scope, these do appear to be independent, national-level research facilities with their own specific focuses. Each has its own publication affiliation usage as well:

ENEA Casaccia Research Centre
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37085367280

ENEA Frascati Research Centre
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37314209000

ENEA Brasimone

ENEA Italian Natiional Institute of Ionizing Radiation Metrology
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37529688700

Use case is similar to #49 and #386, tracking research outputs. I think these should be added to ROR.
