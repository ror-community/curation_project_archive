ACT & American College Testing0339x3x34 and 05183v471","Summary of request: Merge two or more ROR records

Update record:
Name of organization: ACT
ROR ID: https://ror.org/05183v471
Which part of the record needs to be changed? 
Description of change: ACT & American College Testing
ROR ID(s) of organization(s) affected by this change: 0339x3x34 and 05183v471
How should the record(s) be changed? ACT had been a common acronym for American College Testing and I think it is now their official name - https://www.act.org/ - note the URL in the ACT record was never correct so perhaps there is something else conflated with this

Update: change.status==inactive;$

comment_text: From the [Wayback Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20190212192738/http://www.actinternationalservices.com/en/), this appears to been a subsidiary organization for ACT for their international activities. The have a new sub-domain - https://global.act.org - that covers the same ground, but I'm not really seeing this a discrete entity. Since we don't know the full history of this transition, I think the safest thing for now is to list this as inactive and point at the main ACT record (vs. withdrawing).

comment_text: Data repository certification organization that is a cooperative effort between the Data Seal of Approval and the [World Data System](https://www.world-data-system.org/) of the International Science Council, under the umbrella of the [Research Data Alliance](https://rd-alliance.org/) (RDA),. Request here appear to be to add [their board ](https://www.coretrustseal.org/about/standards-and-certification-board/) vs the organization writ large, I'm assuming for ORCID or similar acknowledgement. While all seems legitimate, I'm struggling to see where this would fit within any of our conceptions of a research organization, so I'd appreciate if others could weigh in.
