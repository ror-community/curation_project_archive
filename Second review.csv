comment_text: Successor organization to https://ror.org/049922318, as identified in #955. Pharmaceutical company with offices in the US and UK. Independent, top-level entity with solid affiliation usage. Funds and employs researchers. Should be added to ROR.

#955 suggests we should add both the US and UK branch, but I think we should move away from the practice of creating separate records for national-level corporate offices that we inherited of GRID, barring actual evidence of their independence. Astex, for example, does not maintain separate sites for their two offices, but simply lists them both on their page. What might be needed in the future to accommodate this kind of international reality is for address to be a repeatable field.

In addition, both [UC Berkley](https://ror.org/01an7q238) and the [USDA Agricultural Research Service - Pacific West Area](https://ror.org/03rafms67) are already listed as parent organization for this record, so I'm not certain what we would need to change here. We could add an additional link for the USDA ARS site, as technically this is a repeating field, but it would seem that funding differentiation should happen at the level of the parents.

comment_text: Name change corresponds with organization's website and branding. Name on English site is also ""Nantes Université."" 

In terms of how this merger relates to the listed institutions, the effort is [described](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nantes_Universit%C3%A9) as an [experimental public institution](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regroupement_universitaire#%C3%89tablissements_publics_exp%C3%A9rimentaux), whose terms set a ten year maximum for the merger, with the option for any given institution to withdraw after two years. As such, I don't think we should deprecate these records, but simply identify Nantes Université as a new parent for https://ror.org/00qxv3c44, https://ror.org/02vjkv261, https://ror.org/03nh7d505, and https://ror.org/01jq57122. Nantes Saint-Nazaire School of Fine Art does not have a ROR ID, but I can likewise find no instance of affiliation usage under this or its French name (Beaux-Arts Nantes Saint-Nazaire), so I think it may be fine to leave it out of ROR for now. But would like to hear others' thoughts.

comment_text: Nonprofit focused on public health and social justice issues. While I can't find any instances of affiliation usage, organization's [reports](https://globalhealth5050.org/2022-report/) are frequently referenced in academic literature (e.g. https://human-resources-health.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12960-019-0367-3 ; https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30739-X/fulltext ; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673618331350). We added many similar NPOs, (e.g. https://ror.org/05xz2nh53), so I believe they're in scope for ROR.
