comment_text: Corporate entity that represents 42 ""Research Centers of Catalonia,"" a specific kind of research institute designation granted by the Government of Catalonia. 38 of these already exist in ROR (see related organizations). I reached out to the requester about supplying information for the handful that are missing.

 Facilitates exchange and coordination between these research centers, aggregates and publishes their research outputs, and represents them internationally. Believe this is in scope for ROR.

comment_text: This request still needs to proceed through the review process. This is an independent organization involved in supporting and certifying activities around FAIR data. 

Per follow-up email, the intended use case for a ROR ID is to identify the foundation as the certifying entity for FAIR Implementation Profiles: 

> It is a project with the ENVRI-FAIR consortium (https://envri.eu/home-envri-fair/) that has increased the urgency for the ROR ID. The GFF has been commissioned, along with the Environmental Agency Austria to upgrade a tool call FAIR Implementation Profile Wizard, which helps communities to create machine-readable FAIR Implementation Profiles. The ENVRI-FAIR consortium, in close collaboration with GO FAIR, have been leading the development of the FAIR Implementation Profile method, and the FIP Wizard tool. [...] A key function, namely the GFF “qualification” or endorsement of FAIR Enabling Resources, will require a globally unique and persistent identifier for the GO FAIR Foundation. Hence, our request. 

The foundation does appear as an affiliation in extant publications (e.g., https://doi.org/10.1162/dint_a_00050).

The foundation is related the GO FAIR initiative (https://www.go-fair.org/) as well as to the GO FAIR International Support and Coordination Office (GFISCO) (https://www.go-fair.org/go-fair-initiative/go-fair-offices/). 

I think it is in scope for ROR to represent GO FAIR as an organization that is involved in certifying and producing research, but I think we need to review whether the ROR record should reflect the foundation, the International Support and Coordination Office (GFISCO), or the overall initiative. 

Additional review from curators is needed in order to make a determination about how we should proceed.

Limited affiliation usage, but does have relationship with ROR backer DataCite as a service provider. As far as I can discern, only one person uses this affiliation, so I'm investigating with DataCite whether they're requiring these for service providers.

Other information about this request: This ID has been requested by the DMPTool. In the course of reviewing the request we realized that this organization was previously assigned an ID in GRID (grid.454813.f) and then redirected to the record for the Department of the Interior (grid.239134.e, https://ror.org/03v0pmy70).

comment_text: This is a legacy request that ROR received from DMPTool in 2020. DMPTool requested the ROR ID in order to be able to connect JFSP to the research projects that it funds. We were not able to process the request at that time because the record had previously been deprecated by GRID and was not likely to be reinstated. I am re-opening the request so that we can review it for a future ROR release. I recommend adding to ROR because it is an identified funder associated with published research. It is distinct from the Department of the Interior (the record that GRID redirected it to) because it is jointly operated by both DOI and the US Forest Service.

""Ebsco"" in the publications section refers to them running an EBSCO Discovery Services instance for providing resource access. More an example of ""touches research,"" but we have precedent for another Digital Library initiatives in ROR (e.g. https://ror.org/00p0gp915 ; https://ror.org/03rrpvb29).

This is an independent entity that is also part of the Helmholtz Association (https://ror.org/0281dp749). It is involved in publishing research and supporting researchers. As far as I can tell, publications associated with the office tend to use the main affiliation for the Helmholtz Association, and related IDs are at the association level as well. 

We should consider whether the current representation at the association level is sufficient, or whether a new record should be created to identify the open science office.

The organization is a nonprofit affiliated with the Uniting Church in Australia. It appears that most of the organization's research publications are associated with the Uniting Medically Supervised Injection Centre (Uniting MSIC). We should consider whether to create a ROR ID for Uniting or for Uniting MSIC.

comment_text: This is a legacy request submitted in 2020 by the National Library in Scotland (a partner org). ROR submitted it to GRID but it was not approved at the time so it could not be added to ROR. I am reopening the request so we can review it for inclusion in a future release. 

This is a web archiving project that coordinates with six major libraries in the UK. It does not appear to be used as an affiliation in published research. However, I would propose that we consider it for inclusion as a repository. It is similar to other web archiving projects already represented in ROR, such as the Internet Archive.

Those working on other campuses use a qualifier (e.g. https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1700-6797), but every affiliation usage instance I've found for the Athens location does not.

comment_text: Argentinian university established in 2018 through a legislative act by the autonomous, district-level government of Buenos Aires. No publication affiliation usage I can find, although a fair amount of secondary academic references to the organization. It's not exactly too new or out of scope for ROR, but at a nebulous threshold of being established because of the lack of research outputs.

I'd lean toward inclusion, but also happy to reach out to the organization to clarify their need for a ROR ID at this point in their development.

comment_text: While medical schools are still indeterminately in scope for ROR, this particular organization was created as a joint venture between the University of Kent (https://ror.org/00xkeyj56) and Canterbury Christ Church University (https://ror.org/0489ggv38). Since neither broader affiliation is used on publications when referencing this organization (e.g. https://doi.org/10.2337/db21-0686), I think this in scope.

comment_text: Data consultancy for libraries and digital archives. While their site lists two principals, I can only find publication affiliation usage for one (Nancy Hoebelheinrich). While publication history is solid, it appears a one-person organization in terms of its research outputs and thus would be out of scope.

comment_text: Not certain we should process this as a simple name change. According to Wikipedia, the company was split into two different entities in 2015:

""In August 2015, JDSU split into two different companies: [Viavi Solutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viavi_Solutions) and [Lumentum Holdings](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lumentum_Holdings&action=edit&redlink=1)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDSU#cite_note-3).""

So, we should probably process this as a new record and deprecation request, as well as possible deprecating the non-US records. While they list foreign offices on their site, it's not clear to me that these still constitute independent, top-level entities. The ""Office Locations"" section of their site list a single corporate headquarters and the sales, manufacturing, and research and development facilities.

comment_text: Identified as a parent/related org in https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/issues/442. Monitoring network gathering deposition and precipitate data from various state, federal, and tribal sources. Housed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, but is funded by and combines data from other sources. Publishes annual data summaries, holds conference proceedings and data outputs are frequently cited in research in this domain. Believe this is in scope for ROR.

comment_text: Identified as part of the relationships in #442. Marine research institute that administers graduate programs for the College of William And Mary. Funds and employs researchers who use this as a leading affiliation on plenty of research.

I could go either way on this request, maybe leading towards denying because of how closely tied the are to the university, so would appreciate additional feedback.
