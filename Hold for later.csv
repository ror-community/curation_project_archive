comment_text: According to [this description](http://www.biophys.am/pages/index/About/), the organization has been inactive since 1996, when it was restructured into a new entity:

>""In 1996 the Biophysics Center of Armenian NAS was awarded the status of UNESCO Chair in Life Sciences by UNESCO Director General Mr. Federico Mayor and was reorganized into Life Sciences International Postgraduate Educational Center (LSIPEC). LSIPEC is specialized in Biophysics, Biotechnology, Environmental Health, Neuroscience, Biomedical Engineering.""


It is likewise not listed on the [Armenian NAS page](https://www.sci.am/orgs.php?langid=2).

Since Life Sciences International Postgraduate Educational Center already exists in ROR (https://ror.org/02yqgb753), we should just deprecate this record.

Also, it is relatively new (2020) and is undergoing reorganization: ""The Łukasiewicz Research Network –  Institute of Organisation and Management in Industry is undergoing reorganization and soon will be replaced by a new institute focused on technology assessment. The Institute for Technology Assessment will be operating as a part of the Łukasiewicz Research Network. We work with public institutions, private companies, as well as non-governmental organizations and provide them with expert knowledge about the effects of introducing new technologies."" I found one example of affiliation use (DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.14874.36805). Recommend moving to Hold for later until reorganization is complete and there are more instance of affiliation use.

Maybe what they are referring to with the ""new"" statement is Nick's comment regarding a reorganization and name change in progress?

Anyway, I'm fine with the ""Hold"" for now if it's in the middle of a major change, but I think it clearly should have a ROR id one way or another and soon! Let's revisit before the end of 2021?

comment_text: Some additional comments from the original request that may shed light on the need for a new ROR ID and the center's relationship to OpenCitations:

> The reason that we need two RORs, one for OpenCitations and one for the Research Centre for Open Scholarly Metadata is as follows:

> OpenCitations is distinct from and pre-existed the Research Centre, having grown to become a valuable independent infrastructure from a small beginning as a research project in my lab.

> The Research Centre was created specifically for two purposes: (a) to provide an institutional affiliation, a legal financial centre, and a formal administrative 'home' for OpenCitations, and (b) to permit academic activities affiliated with OpenCitations, such as being the academic home for graduate students of the University of Bologna working on projects involving open citations.  The Research Centre is formally a part of the University of Bologna in a way that OpenCitations is not.

> In the medium-term future, OpenCitations may 'spin out' to become a non-profit foundation /association/Stiftung under direct governance by the wider academic community and other stakeholders, that is administratively and financially independent from the University of Bologna.  In that case, OpenCitations will continue with its stated mission of providing open bibliographic metadata and citations, and the Research Centre will continue as an integral part of the University of Bologna in its academic roles with respect to OpenCitations, and will probably by then also have expanded its activities to include other types of metadata-oriented research work, but it will no longer be administratively and financially responsible for OpenCitations.

> For these reasons of distinctiveness, it would be sensible if OpenCitations and the Research Centre for Open Scholarly Metadata were issued separate RORs from the start, rather than trying to disentangle them at some point down the line.  That was the basis of my thinking when I wrote.

MG notes (sent to requestor for clarification):
It looks as though the ROR ID https://ror.org/040ck2b86 previously referenced the Natural History Museum of Denmark. We have another record in ROR that also refers to a Natural History Museum of Denmark: https://ror.org/0166x0j30. 

Since ROR has previously been synced to GRID, I imagine that what happened is that GRID merged the two records. ROR does not currently support redirected IDs, but this is functionality that we will implement in future. 

I am not sure, however, if it was correct to merge the two IDs referenced above. As far as I can tell, there is a Natural History Museum of Denmark in Aarhus (https://www.naturhistoriskmuseum.dk/, Wikidata Q12328428), and a Natural History Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen (https://snm.ku.dk/, Wikidata Q978464).

`The Natural History Museum in Aarhus and the one in Copenhagen are distinct institutions. The latter is referred to as “Natural History Museum of Denmark” (institution code NHMD), in Danish: “Statens Naturhistoriske Museum” (literally NHM of the State, also reflected in our url: snm.ku.dk), the other simply as “Natural History Museum Aarhus” (institution code NHMA). So the ROR ID https://ror.org/0166x0j30 refers to an entirely different entity (NHMA) leaving us in want of an entry for our own museum (NHMD), previously at: https://ror.org/040ck2b86.

comment_text: I added Wikidata and ISNI id's. This USED to be in GRID (I also added the old GRID id above), and in fact it used to have a ROR id also - https://ror.org/02gn1ar53 (from an old ROR dump I believe) - but GRID merged it into the University of Bremen record, and the ROR link is now dead.

Will look into this a bit more to see if it really should have its own ROR. The independent website marum.de is a good sign.

comment_text: Ok, they have a lot of people publishing using it as an affiliation, but it always in the ones I found it is in the form ""MARUM, ..., University of Bremen"", so that indicates it isn't considered completely independent from the university as far as affiliation listings go.

However, MARUM is one of the hosts for PANGAEA, which is an important Earth & Environmental Science data repository, and they are a significant provider of datasets. This may be a somewhat borderline case, but I think given the scope of their activities and the independent website it should have (restore) a ROR id. Can we re-use the old one for this?

comment_text: Hmm, I think we should wait on this one. There's a very similarly named company that appears to be larger and more well-established, ""Phanes Therapeutics"" - https://www.phanesthera.com/ (from San Diego, established 2016) - for which we do not have a ROR ID, and it seems likely if we create one for this company without creating one for the other that could lead to some confusion. I can't find any relationship between the two, and this company is not listed for example in Crunchbase or mentioned in any news reports I could find.

The publications listed on their ""publications"" page are all from 2017 or earlier as far as I could see, which predates the company formation (so it wouldn't have been used as an affiliation). I recommend we put this on hold until we see they are actually publishing or funding research with this affiliation.

comment_text: Cross-institutional project to develop a new generation sensor/monitoring networks for tracking the habitability of ecological systems in the context of climate change.

The project appears relatively new and in trial phases with a couple of facilities, so there is little in the way of research outputs or affiliation usage. That said, it has the backing of multiple CNRS institutions (e.g. https://www.insu.cnrs.fr/fr/cnrsinfo/terra-forma-un-nouveau-paradigme-pour-lobservation-des-territoires ; ), so I don't think there are any concerns about its viability. More about whether to create a ROR now or await the research outputs, funding acknowledgements, etc.

comment_text: Does the website work at all for you? I just get a blank page at terra-forma.cnrs.fr ??? Anyway, the various other pages that describe this routinely use the word ""project"", and our guidelines suggest ROR's should not be created for a ""term-limited project"". Also it's not clear to me that anybody would actually use this as an affiliation. And their suggested hierarchy would be disruptive I think - we don't want every widely supported project to appear in the hierarchy tree of organizations, this is not really a parent of the listed entities.

I recommend waiting at least 6 months to see actual research outputs and see if any researchers are actually stating TERRA FORMA as their affiliation, rather than the underlying organizations (also to see if the website is actually a stable reliable source of information). If this really is a term-limited project, perhaps we should direct them to request a RAiD identifier rather than ROR - https://www.raid.org.au
