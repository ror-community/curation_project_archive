Information about this request: As the research institute we are obliged to participate in a global scientific network, therefore naturally we hope to become a member of ROR community. We are a new institute (established in May 2020), member of Łukasiewicz Research Network. Till today we do not have any published scientific papers. Our scope of interest revolve around subsequent topics: technology assessment, technology foresight, health technology, inteligent mobility, digital transformation and sustainable development etc.

comment_text: This appears to be a type of consulting organization. Also, it is relatively new (2020) and is undergoing reorganization: ""The Łukasiewicz Research Network –  Institute of Organisation and Management in Industry is undergoing reorganization and soon will be replaced by a new institute focused on technology assessment. The Institute for Technology Assessment will be operating as a part of the Łukasiewicz Research Network. We work with public institutions, private companies, as well as non-governmental organizations and provide them with expert knowledge about the effects of introducing new technologies."" I found one example of affiliation use (DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.14874.36805). Recommend moving to Hold for later until reorganization is complete and there are more instance of affiliation use.

Maybe what they are referring to with the ""new"" statement is Nick's comment regarding a reorganization and name change in progress?

Anyway, I'm fine with the ""Hold"" for now if it's in the middle of a major change, but I think it clearly should have a ROR id one way or another and soon! Let's revisit before the end of 2021?

This USED to be in GRID (I also added the old GRID id above), and in fact it used to have a ROR id also - https://ror.org/02gn1ar53 (from an old ROR dump I believe) - but GRID merged it into the University of Bremen record, and the ROR link is now dead.

Will look into this a bit more to see if it really should have its own ROR. The independent website marum.de is a good sign.

comment_text: Ok, they have a lot of people publishing using it as an affiliation, but it always in the ones I found it is in the form ""MARUM, ..., University of Bremen"", so that indicates it isn't considered completely independent from the university as far as affiliation listings go.

However, MARUM is one of the hosts for PANGAEA, which is an important Earth & Environmental Science data repository, and they are a significant provider of datasets. This may be a somewhat borderline case, but I think given the scope of their activities and the independent website it should have (restore) a ROR id. Can we re-use the old one for this?

comment_text: Cross-institutional project to develop a new generation sensor/monitoring networks for tracking the habitability of ecological systems in the context of climate change.

The project appears relatively new and in trial phases with a couple of facilities, so there is little in the way of research outputs or affiliation usage. That said, it has the backing of multiple CNRS institutions (e.g. https://www.insu.cnrs.fr/fr/cnrsinfo/terra-forma-un-nouveau-paradigme-pour-lobservation-des-territoires ; ), so I don't think there are any concerns about its viability. More about whether to create a ROR now or await the research outputs, funding acknowledgements, etc.

comment_text: Does the website work at all for you? I just get a blank page at terra-forma.cnrs.fr ??? Anyway, the various other pages that describe this routinely use the word ""project"", and our guidelines suggest ROR's should not be created for a ""term-limited project"". Also it's not clear to me that anybody would actually use this as an affiliation. And their suggested hierarchy would be disruptive I think - we don't want every widely supported project to appear in the hierarchy tree of organizations, this is not really a parent of the listed entities.

I recommend waiting at least 6 months to see actual research outputs and see if any researchers are actually stating TERRA FORMA as their affiliation, rather than the underlying organizations (also to see if the website is actually a stable reliable source of information). If this really is a term-limited project, perhaps we should direct them to request a RAiD identifier rather than ROR - https://www.raid.org.au

There are two instances of employment affiliation usage in ORCID (https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4762-0499 and https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2641-081X). While this type of organization isn't necessarily out of scope for ROR, the lack of evidence of research outputs would seem to put it either in ""Hold for Later"" or being out of scope.

comment_text: This is not the only such regional directorate in Peru - a Google search for ""Dirección Regional de Educación"" finds at least a dozen more. These entities seem to be described in the following (Spanish) document: http://www.minedu.gob.pe/files/3993_201207121616.pdf - I don't think they fit our affiliation use case, but it's possible they might qualify as research funders? Not sure, but yes I think hold for later until we know more about this and the other similar government bodies would be the right choice for now.

comment_text: College in Nepal. One instance of affiliation usage for ""Janajyoti Multiple Campus."" Nepal's University Grants Commission does list a ""Janajyoti Campus"" in Lalbandi, although difficult to verify it corresponds to this organization as others appear to share that name and list does appear to distinguish the ""multiple campus"" entities.

However, I think we also need to consider keeping scope manageable and related to affiliation use per [Sustainability & Guiding Principles](https://ror.org/about/). The organizations identified above all have affiliation use in scholarly research:

Lyrasis (https://ror.org/026tem613) - https://api.crossref.org/works/?query.affiliation=%22Lyrasis%22
Digital Science (https://ror.org/020h4b682) - https://api.crossref.org/works/?query.affiliation=%22Digital+Science%22

comment_text: @tema-viktar Apologies, must have been a glitch on our end. Generally speaking, to be added to ROR, we need evidence of research outputs that identify the requested organization as the affiliation for two or more people, as a source of research funding, or as the corporate author or publisher of multiple works. Likewise, the organization's research outputs should be published, indexed, or otherwise distributed to venues other than those belonging to the organization. We could not find evidence that te.ma met these criteria and thus put the request on hold to be reviewed again at a later date. We can, however, reassess if there is additional supporting evidence that te.ma meets these criteria that was not provided in the original request.

comment_text: Hi @vzrenggamani - for an organization to be added to ROR requires that we can find (or you provide) evidence of research outputs by multiple authors using Teknologi Pendidikan ID an affiliation or that the organization is acknowledged as funding research. We were unable to find examples of this for your organization.

comment_text: Hello, thanks for the elaboration,

We are currently conducting research at Malang State University, and we are publishing some of our materials on ResearchGate, but because our institution is relatively new (around 2021), researchgate cannot detect the ""ID Education Technology"" affiliation in the system,

we have published examples of these materials with the affiliation ""Educational Technology"", here are examples:
- http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.30258.27847 (Research related to image detection systems for the introduction of halal products)
- https://doi.org/10.34740/KAGGLE/DSV/4486259 (dataset developed by our team on the introduction of Javanese characters)

Are there any research qualifications that we need to know such as place of publication, article index, whether to accept objects other than research papers

Thank you and please advise

comment_text: @vzrenggamani We have no requirements around place of publication, index, etc, although we don't generally consider presentations in our reviews. Datasets are fine, so long as they have research references or use. Can you indicate where on Kaggle is referenced Teknologi Pendidikan ID? I could not find. Does Teknologi Pendidikan ID exist separately from Malang State University (i.e. as a legally established non-profit organization)?

comment_text: @adambuttrick Thank for the explanation, we now can understand what the requirements are.

In the dataset that we include, we have not changed the affiliation to ID educational technology, because the dataset originated from a project by a group of students. The group of students founded a simple organization called ID Education Technology. In the near future we will publish 5 datasets on kaggle.

If asked how we show the dataset contained on Kaggle is an ID Education Technology affiliate, we can easily change it if the need arises.

If you feel you need more information, maybe this submission can be processed again in early 2023, we will fix the research we are affiliated with.

No affiliation usage as far as I can tell - all existing usage by authors for the form ""LearningLab"" appear to be from an unrelated Danish organization. The link to publications provided is for a journal, ""MedienPädagogik,"" which does not seem to be published or affiliated with the organization (publisher is listed as the Media Education Section of the German Society for Educational Science).

comment_text: Hi Adam,

    so this is an odd case - the actual affiliation we are recording is 
""National Radio Astronomy Observatory, Socorro NM"", - as distinct from 
the NRAO in Green Bank WV (https://ror.org/04m24yn62). I pulled the 
labels from the Wikidata links that we had for these institutions, but 
in this case the Wikidata item is for the facility (The Very Large 
Array), and not the research organization (NRAO Socorro). I'm not sure 
how we should deal with this, but authors associated with it clearly use 
the NM address, not the WV one...

Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY, Germany
is one of the official addresses. See e.g.
[https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevAccelBeams.26.012801](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevAccelBeams.26.012801)

Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY, Germany
Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY, Notkestr. 85, 22607 Hamburg, Germany
Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron DESY, Platanenallee 6, 15738 Zeuthen, Germany
At least it would not be plain wrong.

Sorry to bother you, maybe I'm missing something.
Thanks for your coordination.

We are working on providing support for multiple addresses, which would allow for both Hamburg and Zeuthen to be represented.

comment_text: I'm having some difficulty evaluating this one. The website appears to be broken so it is challenging to get information about the institution. The only information I am able to access on the website mentions that it offers ""Courses designed for entrepreneurs, emerging student leaders (18-22) and a young leaders (15-18) high school program."" However, in a [post](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neil-macintyre-2318516/?originalSubdomain=nz) written by the university's founder, it is mentioned that the university offers advanced degrees. The post also mentions that the university is the only one currently functioning in Myanmar given the current political crisis. 

I would suggest putting the request on hold until we are able to obtain additional information about the university's status and activities.

comment_text: I agree this seems like it would be in scope given research activities and affiliation usage. However, the provided metadata could be improved to support discoverability and disambiguation. E.g., is there a Chinese name? And does the organization have a website (the provided URL seems to be for a press release announcing the creation of this among other laboratories). I found one website that appeared to list the provincial key laboratories in Henan [here](http://kjtj.hnkjt.gov.cn/web/science_list.x?type=4), but I don't seem to be able to identify the cyberspace situational awareness entity on the list. Without additional IDs or other supporting information, I'm not sure if we should move forward on the basis of affiliation usage alone. I'll put this on hold so we can revisit it again if/when additional information is available.

While I can only find this single instance of affiliation usage, the company itself is pan-European with many national-level instances of affiliation usage (e.g.  https://doi.org/10.1111/vsu.13859; https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2022.881274; https://doi.org/10.1111/jsap.13412; https://doi.org/10.1186/s13028-021-00591-1; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0250695), so I think this is okay to add. Assuming this is approved, we should also at the very least create a top-level record for the UK-based company for which these other organizations are subsidiaries.

comment_text: Concur that the [top-level organization](https://ivcevidensia.com/) should be added to ROR. Research affiliations use:

https://api.crossref.org/works/?query.affiliation=IVC+Evidensia

Considering the various forms of affiliation use (""IVC Evidensia"" + location) my preference would be to only add the top-level organization, but can also see the argument for adding each subsidiary that can demonstrate affiliation use.

@adambuttrick - Leaving issue in Second review for now. Perhaps add top-level organization and move IVC Evidensia France to Hold for later?

comment_text: I don't have anything to add - Nick's suggestion to add top-level and wait on the France one sounds like the right way to go.

comment_text: Academic society focused on emergency medical care, formed by students and staff at https://ror.org/037xrmj59. The one DOI provided is all the affiliation usage their seems to be, although features two authors using. They also appear to just have [held their first conference last month.](https://congreso-late.uazuay.edu.ec/). This would appear to fall more in the service organization acknowledgement category, so on the fence about whether we add or Hold for Later. Appears to have existed since 2021, so not brand new.

comment_text: In the one publication we have this isn't really used as an affiliation, but rather part of the ""biography"" section for the authors; in the front-end author section they just list their university affiliations. From their website they seem to be doing some nice outreach work but I'm not sure that's sufficient. I found a couple of other mentions of this organization in Google Scholar but I think there's just not enough there to assess at this point. I'm going to put this in hold for later.
