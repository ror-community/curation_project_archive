Name of organization to be added | Continental Scientific Drilling Facility

Organization website | https://csdco.umn.edu

Briefly explain why you are requesting a ROR ID for this organization and how the ROR ID will be used. | The Continental Scientific Drilling Facility is a national facility funded by NSF for support of scientific research involving drilling and coring on land and in lakes, core analysis, and curation. The ROR ID will allow unique linkages between the facility and the researchers it supports, and the outputs from this research.

Provide DOI(s) or links for research associated with this organization, such as published articles that include the organization's name as an affiliation. If DOIs or links are not available, describe the research-related activities of this organization. | https://experts.umn.edu/en/organisations/continental-scientific-drilling-facility

Other relevant metadata about the organization (e.g., name variants in other languages, related records in ROR, links to external records such as Wikidata) | Name variants include CSD Facility, CSDF, and the former facilities that merged to form the current facility in mid-2020: LacCore and CSDCO (Continental Scientific Drilling Coordination Office). Earlier variants include the Limnological Research Center or LRC, which sometimes still appear in publications.

Please add any other information about this request if needed | We are rebuilding our website and will soon have a new URL, which we will update with ROR when the website launches.

comment_text: Determination: The **Continental Scientific Drilling Coordination Office (CSDCO)** is an NSF research facility sufficiently independent from parent organization (University of Minnesota) and has affiliation use (see https://sd.copernicus.org/articles/26/1/2019/). Recommend adding CSDCO to ROR

comment_text: The request indicates this is a new organization - ""Continental Scientific Drilling Facility"", which combines the older LacCore and CSDCO. I cannot find any reference to this new organization other than the link they provide for publications: https://experts.umn.edu/en/organisations/continental-scientific-drilling-facility and an NSF grant award from May last year: https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1951112

As @nlundvick noted there are affiliations using the older entities (although they also seem to always be at University of Minnesota). The CSDCO website which is the main link provided does not mention the new name. Perhaps we should wait for their new website? Otherwise I do think this is generally suitable.

comment_text: This organization is not already in ROR. Seems like a small organization with 3 people. I can't tell if they are publishing research. The publication page (https://journals.4science.ge/) lists journals, but I wasn't able to find the Association for Science as an affiliation. Some of the journals do not yet have any issues. This may be a new organization that is still getting started. I was unable to find much about the organization in Google or Wikipedia, but that may be because it's a common name. May be helpful to discuss with the group.

We would like to consider reviewing this again in the future when the organization is more established and the website is functional. It also seems as though this organization might be related to Georgia Open Digital Repository and/or Georgia Integrated Library Information System Consortium's Digital Repository, which might need to be included in ROR instead or as well.

The Institute for Technology Assessment will be operating as a part of the Łukasiewicz Research Network.

Maybe what they are referring to with the ""new"" statement is Nick's comment regarding a reorganization and name change in progress?

Anyway, I'm fine with the ""Hold"" for now if it's in the middle of a major change, but I think it clearly should have a ROR id one way or another and soon! Let's revisit before the end of 2021?

comment_text: I have not been able to find this used as an affiliation. Their main website does not seem to work correctly - the English pages are gibberish, and the Macedonian ones don't seem to interlink for the most part? The organization appears to be primarily the publisher of the Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences - https://oamjms.eu/ - this does publish a substantive number of articles every year and has been around for a while. And the organization does have an ISNI entry. So I suppose on those grounds it qualifies for ROR, but I think it's a marginal case.

comment_text: They are a publisher, under their subsidiary ""Maheswari Publishers"", of several (3) language/literature journals in English and Tamil. I can't find either Pandian or Maheswari used as an affiliiation. The ""CARE"" mentioned as listing one of their journals is an Indian university approval organization that approves of journals meeting a certain quality standard. I'm not sure how to confirm they are actually on this list. As a publisher perhaps this should be added? However I'd suggest adding the Maheswari Publishers name as an alias since that seems to be their primary research-related activity.

comment_text: Some additional comments from the original request that may shed light on the need for a new ROR ID and the center's relationship to OpenCitations:

> The reason that we need two RORs, one for OpenCitations and one for the Research Centre for Open Scholarly Metadata is as follows:

> OpenCitations is distinct from and pre-existed the Research Centre, having grown to become a valuable independent infrastructure from a small beginning as a research project in my lab.

> The Research Centre was created specifically for two purposes: (a) to provide an institutional affiliation, a legal financial centre, and a formal administrative 'home' for OpenCitations, and (b) to permit academic activities affiliated with OpenCitations, such as being the academic home for graduate students of the University of Bologna working on projects involving open citations.  The Research Centre is formally a part of the University of Bologna in a way that OpenCitations is not.

> In the medium-term future, OpenCitations may 'spin out' to become a non-profit foundation /association/Stiftung under direct governance by the wider academic community and other stakeholders, that is administratively and financially independent from the University of Bologna.  In that case, OpenCitations will continue with its stated mission of providing open bibliographic metadata and citations, and the Research Centre will continue as an integral part of the University of Bologna in its academic roles with respect to OpenCitations, and will probably by then also have expanded its activities to include other types of metadata-oriented research work, but it will no longer be administratively and financially responsible for OpenCitations.

> For these reasons of distinctiveness, it would be sensible if OpenCitations and the Research Centre for Open Scholarly Metadata were issued separate RORs from the start, rather than trying to disentangle them at some point down the line.  That was the basis of my thinking when I wrote.

comment_text: Hmm, this is seems to be a new funding program, part of the Australian ""National Environmental Science Program"" (NESP), under the Australian government ""Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment"", ROR https://ror.org/030c92375. Neither NESP nor this portion of it seem to have funder ID's. However NESP does have an ISNI id: https://isni.org/isni/0000000494148945 
I don't see any sign of this recovery hub being used as an affiliation. The publications they list are from researchers at other universities in Australia, generally.

If we add something for this to ROR I think we ought to just add NESP which seems to be the higher-level funding organization and is referenced in several places on this recovery hub website. But maybe the existing Australian AWE department is enough?

comment_text: This one is tricky. I think it is used as an affiliation (for example, in https://www.publish.csiro.au/pc/Fulltext/PC19036?subscribe=false), but it is listed alongside Charles Darwin University in this publication, one of the Hub's partner universities (https://www.environment.gov.au/science/nesp/hub-threatened-species-recovery). It appears that all researchers affiliated with the Hub have another research organization as their primary appointment.

I am not sure if adding NESP addresses the issue; to me, it seems less accurate to say that these researchers are affiliated with NESP broadly, than to say they are affiliated with their specific research Hub. The six Hubs seem to function independently from each other (separate websites, etc), although each is accountable to NESP.

Another factor is that this project does not appear to be premised on long-term stability. According to this page, this Hub will not continue to exist past 2021 - it is part of Phase 1 of the NESP: http://www.environment.gov.au/science/nesp/phase-1. There are different Hubs for Phase 2: http://www.environment.gov.au/science/nesp/about.

comment_text: The article referenced in the ""Link to Publications"" is here:  doi:10.1001/jamaneurol.2021.0428 - this is a ""Viewpoint"" article, not a regular research article. Also it doesn't refer to LMSA as an affiliation but (as far as I can see) only in this sentence: ""... long-established organizations (eg, American Academy of Neurology, Student National Medical Association, Latino Medical Student Association) have sponsored virtual specialty panels to increase information access for their members.""

The request mentions articles surveying LMSA members, but that still doesn't seem to really fall into the scope of ROR. While this seems to be a worthwhile organization in what it does, I don't think it needs or qualifies for a ROR id.

comment_text: This seems almost certainly out of scope - they are an advocacy organization, not a research organization. However, the linked (1) publication lists them as a funder, so to the extent that is a research publication perhaps they qualify as funding research? They are not listed in any of our standard reference databases that I can find (no ISNI, Crossref funder entry, no Wikipedia entries). If there's a feeling we shouldn't deny this outright perhaps we could query them for more details on why they are asking for a ROR id?

comment_text: I've never heard of an anthropology  consultant  before, that's interesting! But it appears  from a search for publications  there is just one person using this affiliation -  ""Matt Artz"". There do seem  to be maybe a half-dozen papers by him with this affiliation (from Google Scholar) but I agree this isn't sufficient to justify a ROR id. Let's revisit a year or two down the road to  see if there's more info that can be found or it's clearly more than just one person.

However, I looked in Google Scholar and while there are a number of papers using this affiliation, they all appear to be from a single author - ""Jing Ming"", who is also the author with that affiliation on the publications example provided. The website (which looks like a ""blog"") provides no sign of any other people involved. So I think this does *not* qualify for a ROR id as it appears to be a single-researcher operation. Perhaps this could be revisited in future if they appear to have expanded but for now I don't think this qualifies.

comment_text: I removed the ""Crossref Funder ID"" as that was not a Crossref Funder ID, just a copy of the publication DOI. They appear to be a small publisher with one journal ""African Journal of Political Sciences"" from Algeria which seems to publish in Arabic? Not to be confused with ""African Journal of Political Science"" from South Africa which publishes in English and French. Their website is a mess - at least when I opened it with Chrome most of the pages were blank or almost full of advertising. The journal pages also had ads but they appear to be legitimate political science research papers. They've been around since 2012, or at least that is when the first issue of the journal came out.

So this is a scope question - are we adding small publishers like this one, or not? I'd be inclined to say no. Willing to hear a second opinion though.

Many of their webpages didn't contain content and their About page seem to have formatting errors so that it wasn't readable. The African Journal of Political Sciences is supposed to be OA, but I could access full-text to any of the articles in the publication. There was just metadata and a download button that I was a bit worried about. 

I'm not sure that it makes sense to assign a ROR at this point.

MG notes (sent to requestor for clarification):
It looks as though the ROR ID https://ror.org/040ck2b86 previously referenced the Natural History Museum of Denmark. We have another record in ROR that also refers to a Natural History Museum of Denmark: https://ror.org/0166x0j30. 

Since ROR has previously been synced to GRID, I imagine that what happened is that GRID merged the two records. ROR does not currently support redirected IDs, but this is functionality that we will implement in future. 

I am not sure, however, if it was correct to merge the two IDs referenced above. As far as I can tell, there is a Natural History Museum of Denmark in Aarhus (https://www.naturhistoriskmuseum.dk/, Wikidata Q12328428), and a Natural History Museum of Denmark in Copenhagen (https://snm.ku.dk/, Wikidata Q978464).

`The Natural History Museum in Aarhus and the one in Copenhagen are distinct institutions. The latter is referred to as “Natural History Museum of Denmark” (institution code NHMD), in Danish: “Statens Naturhistoriske Museum” (literally NHM of the State, also reflected in our url: snm.ku.dk), the other simply as “Natural History Museum Aarhus” (institution code NHMA). So the ROR ID https://ror.org/0166x0j30 refers to an entirely different entity (NHMA) leaving us in want of an entry for our own museum (NHMD), previously at: https://ror.org/040ck2b86.

I'm not sure about this one. Searching Goolge scholar I found only a handful of publications from this institute, with 3 different authors, only two of whom actually used the institute as an affiliation; both published only in ""IRJMS"" (https://www.irjms.com) which is a very new journal and seems a little sketchy. The website for the institute seems to be mostly talking about the founder, with great plans for the future and some recent donations etc. but not much that I can see of current status (I don't see any lists of actual researchers anywhere?) I guess it's still a new organization. I'd be inclined to hold this one for later? Willing to defer to a second opinion on this though.

comment_text: Not certain whether this is a sufficiently established organization. It appears to be a yearly conference held in the Bahamas with the intent of establishing a research institute there. From the organization's description of itself on the website: ""This is a proposal to create a center for theoretical research and training of advanced students and postdoctoral scientists at a location on Long Island, Bahamas."" Very limited publication usage as well, generally as a secondary affiliation, e.g.: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140%2Fepjc%2Fs10052-021-09646-z

comment_text: I've heard of this before, it's been around for a while as a conference series (since 2016). But I think it's a one-person project - Guendelman is the one who's been using it as an affiliation, and from Google Scholar it's on 4 or 5 papers at most. If it really does create an institute as proposed then we can add to ROR then; we can move it to ""on hold"" for now, but I think it's likely to remain out of scope for at least a few more years.

The site features two additional publications, for which ""[Seven Past Nine] contributed as main authors,"" both of which were authored by one of the CEOs and use a different affiliation (Edelweiss Connect).

The name listed on the English version of the new website is:
""Shupyk National Healthcare University of Ukraine""

The name in Ukrainian from the website is:
""Національний університет охорони здоров'я України імені П. Л. Шупика""

so I think we should change the primary name and the Ukrainian label as above, and also the website link.

Then add as alias the name they ask for ""PL Shupyk National University of Health of Ukraine"" (this doesn't appear on the website - I think they must have Google translated the Ukrainian name?)

comment_text: Ok, they have a lot of people publishing using it as an affiliation, but it always in the ones I found it is in the form ""MARUM, ..., University of Bremen"", so that indicates it isn't considered completely independent from the university as far as affiliation listings go.

However, MARUM is one of the hosts for PANGAEA, which is an important Earth & Environmental Science data repository, and they are a significant provider of datasets. This may be a somewhat borderline case, but I think given the scope of their activities and the independent website it should have (restore) a ROR id. Can we re-use the old one for this?

comment_text: I'm not very impressed with their website - most of the things you click on do not seem to provide any information (the FAQ, the lists of members, in particular - tried Safari and Chrome). However, it does appear to have been used as an affiliation in publications by more than one or two distinct researchers. Is it really a research organization in the sense that we define it? I guess we do have a precedent as mentioned. So while this might be a borderline case, I do think it should have a ROR id.

comment_text: Bioreactor startup company with MIT affiliations. Appears relatively new without publication affiliation usage (linked publication uses university affiliations). Press references to the company on their site, including, again MIT (https://picower.mit.edu/news/tiny-brains-grown-3d-printed-bioreactor). Clearly involved with biotechnology R&D, but also may be a one or two person entity (contact email is principal developer of the bioreactor). Leaning toward Hold for Later versus denying outright.

comment_text: This looks like a small startup that is attempting to sell a single piece of medical equipment (a 3D-printed bioreactor). While the bioreactor may be used in medical research, I am not seeing anything to indicate the company itself will be involved in scholarly research. Moving to Hold for Later per previous curator's comments.
