comment_text: Turkish publishing services company. Appears to not actually be a publisher, but to help various journal publishers set up OJS instances and do things like register DOIs. Not certain how we feel about these kinds of orgs in terms of scope, but it seems a little far afield from ROR.

comment_text: I think this would not meet our criteria for research organizations given its role as a service provider. Flagging for group discussion to confirm.

Update record:

Which part of the record needs to be changed? 
Description of change: 

Merge/split/deprecate records:
Organizations affected by this change:Department of Biomedicine Basel
ROR ID(s) of organization(s) affected by this change: https://ror.org/03ybx0x41
How should the record(s) be changed? This ID seems out of scope for ROR under criterion ""1. A top-level entity"" as it is only a subdivision within its respective parent organisations (https://ror.org/02nhqek82, https://ror.org/04k51q396, and https://ror.org/02s6k3f65) and not sufficiently independent from them.

In the Swiss and German Open Access Monitors (which rely on dimensions.ai data and ROR; see https://open-access-monitor.de/publications/840366261) the current situation results in an odd display of just one subdivision listed for its respective parent entities. Moreover, a subdivision that is registered with only 32 publications, while the department's output is in reality more than a thousand times that number (see https://edoc.unibas.ch/view/divisions/64.html).

comment_text: Agree with the requestor's assessment of the record's scope. This would be our first example of withdrawing a record for being out of scope, so moving to Need's Discussion.

comment_text: Pulling together details from form response since the request was incomplete. Request here is to add WMU's medical school in some fashion. We would not alias, so this would be a new record request. Medical schools being in or out of scope is a discussion topic in our next curation team meeting, so putting this on hold in the ""Needs Discussion."" Will create full request, dependent on outcome of discussion.
