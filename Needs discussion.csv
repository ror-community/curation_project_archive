comment_text: I'm not sure on the relation between this and #297 - I assume the same parent organization (or is #297 the parent for this?) Anyway, this organization seems to be a research services provider. Once again the publication list they provide is not one, and again there's no sign of citation or acknowledgement with this name in Google Scholar, but I do find for example several dozen employees listed on LinkedIn, and they seem to have a presence in the US as well as India, possibly other locations. Should we try to insist on them providing actual published articles or datasets relating to this organization? I suppose this could be added to ROR but it seems marginal without further evidence of actual published research, outside of their own website. Really not sure what to do here.

comment_text: Definitely a new substantive research facility that will surely have lots of publications, should be in ROR. According to the Wikipedia page it was previously known as ""Large Scale Cryogenic Gravitational Wave Telescope"" (LCGT), so maybe that name should be also added. Either way KAGRA should have a ROR id.

comment_text: KAGRA appears to be associated with the Gravitational Wave Group at the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research, which is based at the University of Tokyo. There is a list of related publications here: https://www.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/gr/GWPOHPe/reports-e.html. 

The ICRR is based at the University of Tokyo, but it is referred to as an ""inter-university research institute"" (https://www.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/about-icrr-2/directors-greetings/). I think it's sufficiently independent that we could add the ICRR to ROR, but I'm not sure if KAGRA is in scope. Do we have other examples of facilities like this in ROR?

If we do add KAGRA, we might want to add some of the other ICRR facilities listed here: https://www.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/facility/.

comment_text: Ah, good to point that out. The KAGRA website is under ICRR's domain, but as it notes: ""KAGRA is hosted by the Institute for Cosmic Ray Research (ICRR), the University of Tokyo, and co-hosted by the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) and National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ)"" so it's not purely part of University of Tokyo.
Among the ""ICRR facilities"", I believe CTA does have a ROR id already (and is also not just a U Tokyo facility): https://ror.org/020jy7109
Kamioka Observatory I think also deserves one, it's a major physics research facility that's been operating for decades. Not sure about the others.
That said, ICRR is a pretty major institute in its own right and maybe should have a ROR even though it is indeed part of U Tokyo. It does seem to have its own Crossref Funder ID: https://doi.org/10.13039/501100013260

comment_text: Going by their English ""about"" page - https://www.rj.se/en/about-rj2/ the English name they use is ""Riksbankens Jubileumsfond"", with abbreviation ""RJ"". The Swedish name we have seems what they use on the Swedish version of that page (""Stiftelsen Riksbankens Jubileumsfond""). Their request regarding ""For the advancement of the Humanities and Social sciences"" seems confused - unless they consider it part of a full official name (for example we could add ""Riksbankens Jubileumsfond For the advancement of the Humanities and Social sciences"" as an alternate label I guess) I don't think we have a place for logo text like that in ROR.

So I recommend replacing the primary label with their English label ""Riksbankens Jubileumsfond"", retaining the Swedish label, adding ""RJ' as an acronym, and keeping the former primary label as another alternate label.

comment_text: I'm not sure about removing the word ""Stiftelsen"" because it doesn't appear on the English version on the website. Arguments for including it:

- From what I can tell, ""Stiftelsen"" (which means ""foundation"") is part of their official Swedish name - they may have just thought it was awkward or redundant to translate on the English side? I wouldn't attribute too much significance to that omission. I'm not seeing evidence that ""Riksbankens Jubileumsfond"" an official ""English"" name - particularly because it's still Swedish! I think it's just a short name.
- The word ""Foundation"" is already part of their current English translated name in ROR.
- There are other Swedish foundations in ROR that keep the word ""Stiftelsen"": https://ror.org/search?query=stiftelsen

My proposal:
- primary name: use the full name, ""Stiftelsen Riksbankens Jubileumsfond""
- alias/label: ""Riksbankens Jubileumsfond"" - if added as a label, I would say it is Swedish for language, not English
- label: ""Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation"" (English)
- acronyms: ""RJ""

For the request on ""For the advancement of the Humanities and Social sciences"", I think they might be referring to the alias we have, ""The Swedish Foundation for Humanities and Social Sciences"" - we are missing the word ""Advancement"". Not sure if we should update this alias or remove it, if we don't normally include taglines like this?

comment_text: Agree with Kelly's proposal, with one caveat - I don't think we need to add ""Riksbankens Jubileumsfond"" as an alias or label. It's a substring of the primary name and we don't typically include those as alternate forms. Searching this substring by itself would already returns the full ""Stiftelsen Riksbankens Jubileumsfond"" name in the API and site. You can see this now by searching for just ""Sweden Tercentenary"" and returning https://ror.org/02jkbm893.

comment_text: I received some additional information from the requesting organization that might help us come to a decision. The comments came from 3 different colleagues. The questions about handling deprecated/redirected IDs is something we don't have a solution for yet, but will be exploring this year. 

> In relation to your question on whether or not to update the existing record or create a new record for UKHSA please see comments below from staff here:
>  
> **Comment 1**
> I can’t see any disadvantages with a new entry for UKHSA. Obviously the PHE entry would need to indicate that PHE no longer exists. Would the PHE entry stay visible? If yes, then a suitable contact, presumably at UKHSA, should be supplied.
>  
> **Comment 2**
> Creating a new record for UKHSA should not be a disadvantage, but if a new record for UKHSA is created will it show that it was previously linked to PHE or are all the records on the ROR standalone records where no relationship/predecessor organisations are shown?
>  
> **Comment 3**
> I think the reason we were thinking to initially update/modify the existing record rather than create a new record was because we know of at least one current service that is using the ROR to identify organisations, and this is a journal checker tool: https://journalcheckertool.org/. Currently this journal checker tool is using PHE’s ROR ID, so if a new record is created for UKHSA it will mean we will have to contact this service to get them to change the organisation name/ROR ID to UKHSA. We are also unsure of any other services that are currently using PHE’s ROR ID that may need to be contacted if there is a new record created on the ROR for UKHSA. Although admittedly services currently using the PHE ROR ID might not be dynamically updating anyway, so even if the existing PHE ROR record was only updated/modified to show details of the new organisation these services may still need to be contacted to get them to manually update their information.

comment_text: Weighing in here - to me, it's significant that the website says PHE has been replaced by UKHSA **and** the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities. If we modify PHE to UKHSA, we aren't representing the change accurately - and in cases where the previous ROR ID was used as an affiliation, staff who are now part of the OHID will be mislabeled as affiliated with UKHSA.

I support creating a new ROR ID for _both_ the new organizations - UKHSA and OHID - and relating these organizations back to PHE. This does mean that services that use the PHE ROR, like the journal checker tool, will need to make changes. 

Unfortunately, I think this is part of the messiness of government departments... we have similar cases in Canada that I have noticed in ROR (both federal and provincial level), which I haven't submitted yet. Ultimately, I would be interested to see ROR add predecessor/successor relationship types, for cases that are not a straightforward name change.

comment_text: Looking at the [guidance for common organization types](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/wiki/Curator-Evaluation-Workflow:-New-Records#guidance-for-evaluating-common-organization-types), we specify that for a museum within a university, ""Add to ROR if: they are producing research and the museum is used as an affiliation."" I agree that the  museum by itself is not used as an affiliation - for example, the museum director uses his university affiliation on his ORCID: https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1259-3363 

However, this feels like a fine line that we're drawing here. The example in the guidance is the UC Berkeley Museum of Vertebrate Zoology (https://ror.org/01rdg4502) - I'm not sure if the difference between these two examples is significant:
- The [UCMVZ website](https://mvz.berkeley.edu/) is also hosted within the UC Berkeley domain, and although it doesn't mention a department, it is a [research unit within the university](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/research-units?for=All&search=&rut=All&page=4).
- Both museums are listed in GBIF: [UCMVZ](https://www.gbif.org/grscicoll/institution/59175240-4500-42b9-9e98-42ae299a5e9b/metrics), [Lund University Biological Museum](https://www.gbif.org/grscicoll/institution/13edc77b-7023-4ddd-89c7-d883a480b294)

comment_text: Can find no instances of affiliation usage. Publication provided is an announcement from the org's website describing the opening of the facility, seemingly as part of North China Electric Power University. Would need something else further to establish its independence. Otherwise, appears out of scope. Would recommend rolling up to primary ROR ID for North China Electric Power University (https://ror.org/04qr5t414)

comment_text: Hmm, when I search the exact proposed name on Google Scholar I get a lot of hits:
https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=30&q=%22Suzhou+institute+of+North+China+Electric+Power+University%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,33
However they all appear to be publications in Chinese journals, which can be downloaded only from CNKI (and I don't have access)?
I think this is a major research institute, well-established (since at least 2012, I don't know where the 2021 date came from in the input data) and it is physically separate from the main university. On the other hand their website domain is a subdomain of the main university site, and there's no sign they have another ""parent"" organization besides the university. So if we were including non-top-level institutes then I think this should definitely be in ROR; as it is it probably is out of scope. But maybe needs further discussion? If we had somebody more familiar with Chinese organizations that might help here!

comment_text: Fixed the date, since this was appears to have been a typo in the request. 

@arthurpsmith Good catch. I had assumed these were errant as they did not appear in the author affiliations or the page source of the CNKI pages. After subtracting out the CNKI articles that were polluting the Google Scholar results, I was able to find ""Suzhou institute of North China Electric Power University"" as an affiliation in IEEE (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6330107 ; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6896157 ; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6330107), with the only caveat being that the author's profiles use the university affiliation, not the institute (e.g., https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37304066300 ; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37405735500 ; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38543674000).

comment_text: Unfortunately, this request isn't as simple as an ISNI change. The current URL in the ROR record points to the University of the French Antilles. The Wikidata ID (https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q829169) points at the University of the French West Indies and Guiana, which appears to have been split into to different entities in 2015 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_the_French_Antilles). 

So, we need to make a determination if this record represents the historic form of the organization before it split, deprecate it, and create a new record to reflect the University of the French Antilles entry (with the updated ISNI), or pursue some other kind of representation.

comment_text: Under the Horizon 2020 scheme, the ERA-NET funding program has been merged into a single instrument, with the goal of ""topping up"" funding for trans-European research across various domains. Full description of the instrument [here](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/cross-cutting-issues/era-net_en.htm). We have a precedent in ROR, inherited from GRID, of a specific ERA-NET instrument from prior to their merging into a single instrument - ERA Plant Genomics https://ror.org/055pf8065.

I've added Brussels as a location because of the scheme originating with the European Commission, but please let me know if anyone thinks another location would be more appropriate. This specific request came in from a funding recipient looking to use ROR to acknowledge their funders.

I think this item might need some extra discussion. Looking at the [Checklist for evaluating new organizations](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/wiki/Curator-Evaluation-Workflow:-New-Records#checklist-for-evaluating-new-organizations), most criteria are not met. Also the type ""funding scheme"" does not exist as a type of organization in the [Guidance for evaluating common organization types](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/wiki/Curator-Evaluation-Workflow:-New-Records#guidance-for-evaluating-common-organization-types). Technically, the ERC Research Council (https://ror.org/0472cxd90) is the organization behind the funding scheme ERA-Net Cofund.

""The main and compulsory activity of the ERA-NET Cofund under Horizon 2020 is the implementation of the co-funded joint call for proposals that leads to the funding of trans-national research and/or innovation projects (one co-funded call per Grant Agreement)."" https://www.era-learn.eu/support-for-partnerships/cofunded-p2p/era-net-cofund 

A use case, where a funder ID might be needed, is the funding reference in the DataCite metadata schema:
```
<fundingReference>
<funderName>European Commission</funderName>
<funderIdentifier funderIdentifierType=""Crossref Funder ID"">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</funderIdentifier>
<awardNumber awardURI=""https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/100603_en.html"">284382</awardNumber>
<awardTitle>
Institutionalizing global genetic-resource commons. Global Strategies for accessing and using essential public knowledge assets in the life sciences
</awardTitle>
</fundingReference>
```

However, ""ERA-Net Cofund"" cannot be found in either ISNI or Crossref Funder Registry.

And regarding the entry mentioned in the initial post, the ""Year established"" shows 9999. Is this used as a placeholder?
