I am thinking it would be best to update/modify the existing PHE record because the majority of PHE functions are now part of UKHSA and the site locations of the main PHE sites are the same as previously.

comment_text: There is a new wikidata ID also: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q104336949
It is still part of the Department of Health and Social Care.
There does NOT seem to be an ISNI for the new agency. I think it would be confusing to re-use this ROR id for the new one. I believe we should create a new ID for this since there are so many differences, and the previous organization was not entirely folded into the new one:
* Primary name: UK Health Security Agency
* Acronym: UKHSA
* Type: Government
* Established: 2020
* Country: United Kingdom
* Website: https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-health-security-agency
* Wikipedia link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK_Health_Security_Agency
* Wikidata ID: https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q104336949
* Parent organization: https://ror.org/03sbpja79

comment_text: I received some additional information from the requesting organization that might help us come to a decision. The comments came from 3 different colleagues. The questions about handling deprecated/redirected IDs is something we don't have a solution for yet, but will be exploring this year. 

> In relation to your question on whether or not to update the existing record or create a new record for UKHSA please see comments below from staff here:
>  
> **Comment 1**
> I can’t see any disadvantages with a new entry for UKHSA. Obviously the PHE entry would need to indicate that PHE no longer exists. Would the PHE entry stay visible? If yes, then a suitable contact, presumably at UKHSA, should be supplied.
>  
> **Comment 2**
> Creating a new record for UKHSA should not be a disadvantage, but if a new record for UKHSA is created will it show that it was previously linked to PHE or are all the records on the ROR standalone records where no relationship/predecessor organisations are shown?
>  
> **Comment 3**
> I think the reason we were thinking to initially update/modify the existing record rather than create a new record was because we know of at least one current service that is using the ROR to identify organisations, and this is a journal checker tool: https://journalcheckertool.org/. Currently this journal checker tool is using PHE’s ROR ID, so if a new record is created for UKHSA it will mean we will have to contact this service to get them to change the organisation name/ROR ID to UKHSA. We are also unsure of any other services that are currently using PHE’s ROR ID that may need to be contacted if there is a new record created on the ROR for UKHSA. Although admittedly services currently using the PHE ROR ID might not be dynamically updating anyway, so even if the existing PHE ROR record was only updated/modified to show details of the new organisation these services may still need to be contacted to get them to manually update their information.

comment_text: Weighing in here - to me, it's significant that the website says PHE has been replaced by UKHSA **and** the Office for Health Improvement and Disparities. If we modify PHE to UKHSA, we aren't representing the change accurately - and in cases where the previous ROR ID was used as an affiliation, staff who are now part of the OHID will be mislabeled as affiliated with UKHSA.

I support creating a new ROR ID for _both_ the new organizations - UKHSA and OHID - and relating these organizations back to PHE. This does mean that services that use the PHE ROR, like the journal checker tool, will need to make changes. 

Unfortunately, I think this is part of the messiness of government departments... we have similar cases in Canada that I have noticed in ROR (both federal and provincial level), which I haven't submitted yet. Ultimately, I would be interested to see ROR add predecessor/successor relationship types, for cases that are not a straightforward name change.

comment_text: I agree with Kelly's assessment. We should create two records for the successor organizations, although we would have to determine what proper redirect for this case would be. I will flag this as an example in our development discussions, as well as the predecessor/successor relationship types as a potential change to the data model.

comment_text: Can find no instances of affiliation usage. Publication provided is an announcement from the org's website describing the opening of the facility, seemingly as part of North China Electric Power University. Would need something else further to establish its independence. Otherwise, appears out of scope. Would recommend rolling up to primary ROR ID for North China Electric Power University (https://ror.org/04qr5t414)

comment_text: Hmm, when I search the exact proposed name on Google Scholar I get a lot of hits:
https://scholar.google.com/scholar?start=30&q=%22Suzhou+institute+of+North+China+Electric+Power+University%22&hl=en&as_sdt=0,33
However they all appear to be publications in Chinese journals, which can be downloaded only from CNKI (and I don't have access)?
I think this is a major research institute, well-established (since at least 2012, I don't know where the 2021 date came from in the input data) and it is physically separate from the main university. On the other hand their website domain is a subdomain of the main university site, and there's no sign they have another ""parent"" organization besides the university. So if we were including non-top-level institutes then I think this should definitely be in ROR; as it is it probably is out of scope. But maybe needs further discussion? If we had somebody more familiar with Chinese organizations that might help here!

comment_text: Fixed the date, since this was appears to have been a typo in the request. 

@arthurpsmith Good catch. I had assumed these were errant as they did not appear in the author affiliations or the page source of the CNKI pages. After subtracting out the CNKI articles that were polluting the Google Scholar results, I was able to find ""Suzhou institute of North China Electric Power University"" as an affiliation in IEEE (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6330107 ; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6896157 ; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6330107), with the only caveat being that the author's profiles use the university affiliation, not the institute (e.g., https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37304066300 ; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37405735500 ; https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/38543674000).

comment_text: Under the Horizon 2020 scheme, the ERA-NET funding program has been merged into a single instrument, with the goal of ""topping up"" funding for trans-European research across various domains. Full description of the instrument [here](https://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/docs/h2020-funding-guide/cross-cutting-issues/era-net_en.htm). We have a precedent in ROR, inherited from GRID, of a specific ERA-NET instrument from prior to their merging into a single instrument - ERA Plant Genomics https://ror.org/055pf8065.

I've added Brussels as a location because of the scheme originating with the European Commission, but please let me know if anyone thinks another location would be more appropriate. This specific request came in from a funding recipient looking to use ROR to acknowledge their funders.

I think this item might need some extra discussion. Looking at the [Checklist for evaluating new organizations](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/wiki/Curator-Evaluation-Workflow:-New-Records#checklist-for-evaluating-new-organizations), most criteria are not met. Also the type ""funding scheme"" does not exist as a type of organization in the [Guidance for evaluating common organization types](https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/wiki/Curator-Evaluation-Workflow:-New-Records#guidance-for-evaluating-common-organization-types). Technically, the ERC Research Council (https://ror.org/0472cxd90) is the organization behind the funding scheme ERA-Net Cofund.

""The main and compulsory activity of the ERA-NET Cofund under Horizon 2020 is the implementation of the co-funded joint call for proposals that leads to the funding of trans-national research and/or innovation projects (one co-funded call per Grant Agreement)."" https://www.era-learn.eu/support-for-partnerships/cofunded-p2p/era-net-cofund 

A use case, where a funder ID might be needed, is the funding reference in the DataCite metadata schema:
```
<fundingReference>
<funderName>European Commission</funderName>
<funderIdentifier funderIdentifierType=""Crossref Funder ID"">https://doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</funderIdentifier>
<awardNumber awardURI=""https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/100603_en.html"">284382</awardNumber>
<awardTitle>
Institutionalizing global genetic-resource commons. Global Strategies for accessing and using essential public knowledge assets in the life sciences
</awardTitle>
</fundingReference>
```

However, ""ERA-Net Cofund"" cannot be found in either ISNI or Crossref Funder Registry.

And regarding the entry mentioned in the initial post, the ""Year established"" shows 9999. Is this used as a placeholder?
