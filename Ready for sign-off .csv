comment_text: From the [organization's site](https://www.mib.infn.it/main/pages/infnmib/la-sezione.php), https://ror.org/03xejxm22 would appear to have some relationship to https://ror.org/01ynf4891:

""The INFN office in Milano Bicocca, housed in the premises of the Physics Department G. Occhialini of the University of Milan Bicocca, has been active since January 2001, and officially became an INFN Section as of September 1, 2006.""

But the request correctly identifies that this is not a parent child. My thinking is we should change this to related, but it would be helpful if someone else could review.

comment_text: Request is a bit perplexing, as it seems to want us to index the child organization with its parents identifiers. We wouldn't do that, but other metadata in the record is out of date, thus correcting.

comment_text: Was formerly independent and than integrated into  https://ror.org/04p9k2z50 in 1995, per the organization's history page. I'm likewise seeing affiliation usage that does not reference the https://ror.org/04p9k2z50 and it appears to have its own research institutes (e.g. https://doi.org/10.1007/s13132-012-0084-9 https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-008-9812-2). Likewise, has an ISNI and separate domain. One of those edge-cases where you could go either way, so would appreciate a Second Review.

comment_text: I can see how it could go either way, but my sense is that https://ror.org/02d9gec76 should be reactivated.  

Esade has distinct campuses and distinct branding, indicating something like a parent-child relationship with Ramon Llull University. 

Some of the affiliation usage is specifically ""ESADE business school""

comment_text: Non-profit/professional organization for software engineers. No affiliation usage I can find. All DOIs provided appear to be either be describing the organization or for individual members vs referencing the organization. They look to be hosting their first conference this year. I'm seeing some references to national laboratories in some of the DOI as well. @nlundvick is this something you've come across?

comment_text: Hi @adambuttrick - I am not familiar with this organization. That said, it's fairly new (est. ~2018). Multiple individuals from research universities and U.S. DOE labs are members of the association. They published their 2020 and 2021 annual meetings, albeit on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcl3QY1lBzY; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKIbS16D8XU). ROR has a large amount of professional organizations in the registry. A couple of similar ones are https://ror.org/05cj88g33 and https://ror.org/00agrkd75. Considering this, and the fact that they will be conducting a conference in October 2023, I would consider this organization to be in scope.

comment_text: NSF-funded ocean monitoring initiative. The affiliation usage seems fine, but there are a couple of wrinkles: 

- This is explicitly listed as a term-limited project that,  ""...will run from Oct. 1, 2021 to Sept. 30, 2025.""
- It has no concrete location or institutional base. We would need at least one reference location to create the record.

We've seen similar distributed research infrastructure in the European and other contexts, although typically with a more solid grounding in the cases where we've added. The request indicates the intent to add ""dozens of observatories, research groups, and data facilities around the globe"" as child organizations over time, so I'm assuming this will serve as the parent record under which all of these would sit.

If others are fine with this, we can add. I can also check in with the requestor to get a better sense of the project's current level of operation and intended use of ROR IDs.

comment_text: @adambuttrick : Yes, that is a tricky discussion. There are several other university libraries in Germany that fall in the same category as University Library Johann Christian Senckenberg, e.g. the previously declined https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/issues/268 and https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/issues/24 . Was there a specific need from OASwitchboard to have a specific ROR for this institution and not use https://ror.org/04cvxnb49 ? Right now, I can only see the category ""German National Libraries"" in their list (https://www.oaswitchboard.org/participants) followed by entries for the universities.

comment_text: @MSpenger Yes, they’re working with a partner who has specifically requested these libraries. Am I correct in assuming these serve a dual state (at either the national or regional-level) and university function? If so, we may need to revisit this use case in the context of the monthly meeting. I did mention to OA Switchboard that we usually roll these up to their parents.

comment_text: Yes, we could take the case, that when a library fulfills the dual state (at either the national or regional-level) and university function, as a criteria for issuing a ROR ID. This would definitely be the case for University Library Johann Christian Senckenberg https://www.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/ueber/landes.html

comment_text: Request from OA Switchboard as part of publisher integration. Long-standing library in Germany. University libraries are generally out of scope, but this appears to have a distinct state/cultural function as well.

comment_text: This is similar to https://github.com/ror-community/ror-updates/issues/3040 as this library is serving the dual state (in this case at the regional level) and university function.

comment_text: Confusing hierarchy, similar to #928. Affiliation usage has this pretty far nested within other organizations (e.g. [""Metabolic Research Laboratories and MRC Metabolic Diseases Unit, Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science, Addenbrooke's Hospital, University of Cambridge""](https://doi.org/10.1002/cphy.c170047)), which leans toward it being out of scope. The parent organization, [Wellcome-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science](https://www.ims.cam.ac.uk/) may be the better ""intermediate"" organization here, as it shares the qualities of being a joint venture between the Medical Research Council and University of Cambridge.

comment_text: I added the ISNI in the metadata above.

However, I agree this one seems to be part of at least two larger organizations that are more clearly ""top-level"". Just looking at the website we have:

http://www.ims.cam.ac.uk/ - Wellcome/MRC Institute of Metabolic Science - https://ror.org/0264dxb48
https://www.mrl.ims.cam.ac.uk/ - Metabolic Research Laboratories (not in ROR)

and then this seems to be a part of the second. So I think this is already covered by https://ror.org/0264dxb48 - perhaps this and ""Metabolic Research Laboratories"" should be listed as alternate names on that record? Anyway I think we are agreed this one actually does seem out of scope for ROR right now.

comment_text: Dear all,

I am following up this case in response to your rejection that MRC Metabolic Diseases Unit (MDU) should not have its own ROR. 

After discussing with colleagues, we believe that the MRC MDU should have its own entry based on the following:

1.	The MRC Epidemiology Unit (EU) which also falls under the Wellcome-MRC Institute of Metabolic Sciences and has its own entry on ROR ([https://ror.org/052578691). This Unit has the same status as the Metabolic Diseases Unit and so if the EU has its own entry then it is logical for MDU to have its own entry as well. 

2.	The MRC MDU is a research organisation in its own right. 

3.	Finally papers published by the unit are mostly in the following format ‘Metabolic Research Laboratories and MRC Metabolic Diseases Unit, Wellcome Trust-MRC Institute of Metabolic Science’. This wording can be found on papers affiliated to the unit via EuropePMC: (https://europepmc.org/search?query=%28AFF%3A%22MRC%20Metabolic%20Diseases%20Unit%22%29&page=1)

I am in the process of ensuring that all MRC units and Institutes are included in the Journal Tracker Tool (https://journalcheckertool.org/). The tool, which pulls data from the Research Organisation Registry, is used by researchers to assess what options they have for publishing in a journal and whether it complies with the UKRI Open Access Policy. Not having an ROR ID excludes researchers at MRC MDU from taking advantage of available tools and puts them at a serious disadvantage compared to their peers at other MRC units.

If there is anything else I can do to provide more evidence, please let me know and I can look into it further.

Kind regards,

Michael Cherrington
Policy and Information Manager
Medical Research Council
